 ORDER
Allen Wiley, a Kentucky prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court's order and judgment granting summary judgment to the defendants in his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights action. Wiley has filed a motion for the appointment of counsel. This case has been referred to a panel of the court that, upon examination, unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).
Wiley commenced this action against the Kentucky Department of Corrections and several employees of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, including Warden Randy White, Grievance Coordinator Dan Smith, Corrections Officer ("CO") Terry Griffin, CO Stephen Mitchell, CO J. Knight, Sergeant Brendan Inglish, Lieutenant Jesse Coombs, Sergeant Gage Rodriguez, CO Burnett, and CO Chase Byrum. Wiley alleged that, on July 10, 2017, while [*2]  in line waiting to be searched before going to dinner, Griffin grabbed him and pushed him against a concrete wall "with a cert team bat in his hand," while Chase "placed metal restraints excessively tight on [his] two wrists and hands[, which] swelled up instantly." He further alleged that Griffin and Mitchell then forced him to walk bent over with a baton under his shoulders and his hands raised as high as they could go. Wiley stated that, when he fell face first to the ground, Inglish "started twisting [his] ankle" and forced him to walk. When he fell a third time, Inglish ordered Knight to shoot him in the lower back with a taser. After Knight shot Wiley with the taser, Griffin grabbed Wiley by his shirt and dragged him across the concrete floor. Wiley further alleged that, on August 13, 2017, when Coombs, Rodriguez, and Burnett came to search his cell, Coombs threatened him with pepper spray. Wiley claimed that the defendants' excessive use of force caused a wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain in violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment.
After initial screening of the complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, the district court allowed Wiley's individual-capacity claims of excessive force against White, [*3]  Griffin, Byrum, Inglish, Mitchell, and Knight to proceed and dismissed Wiley's claims against Smith, Coombs, Rodriguez, and Burnett for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or for seeking monetary relief from defendants immune from such relief. White, Griffin, Byrum, Inglish, Mitchell, and Knight then filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for summary judgment on the grounds that Wiley failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act ("PLRA") and that his claims were barred by claim preclusion. The district court denied the motion to dismiss and, after allowing Wiley an opportunity to file a supplemental response to the motion for summary judgment, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants based on Wiley's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.
On appeal, Wiley argues that his failure administratively to exhaust his claims against White, Griffin, Byrum, Inglish, Mitchell, and Knight should be excused because the grievance process was unavailable to him.1 
We review de novo a district court's order granting summary judgment, Sagan v. United States, 342 F.3d 493, 497 (6th Cir. 2003), and a district court's dismissal of a prisoner's [*4]  suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Does 8-10 v. Snyder, 945 F.3d 951, 961 (6th Cir. 2019). Summary judgment is proper "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of pointing to the record to establish an "absence of genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its burden of production, the nonmoving party cannot rest on its pleadings, but must present "specific facts" in support of his claims to defeat the motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
Under the PLRA, prisoners are required to exhaust all available administrative remedies prior to filing civil rights suits in federal court. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007). "To exhaust his administrative remedies, a prisoner must adhere to the institutional grievance policy, including any time limitations." Risher v. Lappin, 639 F.3d 236, 240 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90-91, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006)). An inmate must "make 'affirmative efforts to comply with the administrative procedures,'" and we "analyze[ ] whether those 'efforts to exhaust were sufficient under the circumstances.'" Id. (quoting Napier v. Laurel County, 636 F.3d 218, 224 (6th Cir. 2011)). However, a prisoner need not exhaust an "unavailable" grievance process, i.e. (1) a grievance process that "operates as a simple dead [*5]  end," (2) a grievance process that is "so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use," or (3) "when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation." Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1859-60, 195 L. Ed. 2d 117 (2016). "Because the Defendants bear the burden of proof on exhaustion, they bear an 'initial summary judgment burden [that] is higher in that [they] must show that the record contains evidence satisfying [their] burden of persuasion' and 'that no reasonable jury would be free to disbelieve it.'" Does 8-10, 945 F.3d at 961 (alterations in original) (quoting Surles v. Andison, 678 F.3d 452, 455-56 (6th Cir. 2012)). Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Wiley, we hold that the defendants fail to meet their initial burden.
The Kentucky Department of Corrections Policies and Procedures ("CPP") sets forth a four-step inmate grievance process, beginning with filing the grievance. CPP 14.6 (II)(J). On July 17, 2017, Wiley filed a grievance concerning the July 10, 2017 incident involving the assaults—grievance number 17-07-103-G. R. 22-1 (July 17, 2017 Grievance) (Page ID #135). In it, he requested that the corrections officers involved "be held accountable and removed from their positions." Id. Grievance [*6]  Coordinator Smith rejected the grievance because (1) it asked for inappropriate action to be taken, (2) was filed more than five days after the incident, and (3) grieved a non-grievable issue. R. 22-1 (July 17, 2017 Grievance Rejection Notice) (Page ID #134). The record shows that Wiley complied with the CPP in all respects except the first, and the defendants fail show that the grievance process was available to Wiley.
Wiley complied with the CPP grievance process as to the second and third justifications given for rejecting his grievance. First, the present record demonstrates that Wiley filed his grievance in a timely manner. The CPP provides that inmates have "five (5) business days after the incident occurs" to file a grievance. CPP 14.6 (II)(J)(1)(a)(2) (emphasis added). The incident here took place on Monday, July 10, 2017, and Wiley filed his grievance on Monday, July 17, 2017. Thus, his grievance was timely. Second, the defendants actually argue in their motion for summary judgment that Wiley grieved a grievable issue. R. 22 (Mot. for Summ. J. at 5-6) (Page ID #113-14). Therefore, the defendants cannot rely on these two justifications to argue that Wiley failed to exhaust his [*7]  grievance by way of noncompliance with the CPP.
This leaves the defendants with only the first justification for rejection of the grievance—Wiley asking for inappropriate disciplinary action to be taken against the defendant COs. The CPP provides that "[a]n inmate filing a grievance concerning a staff member shall not suggest a specific form of disciplinary action." CPP 14.6 (II)(J)(1)(a)(9). "The Grievance Coordinator may reject a grievance that does not comply with the grievance process requirements." CPP 14.6 (II)(J)(1)(a)(11). Because Wiley's grievance requested that the COs be removed from their positions, the defendants assert that it did not comply with the grievance process requirements.
Nevertheless, the defendants fail to show that a reasonable jury must conclude that the grievance process was actually available to Wiley. It is true that "[a] plaintiff's failure to exhaust cannot be excused by his ignorance of the law or the grievance policy," Napier, 636 F.3d at 221 n.2, but this is only so when the plaintiff has "had a fair, reasonable opportunity to apprise himself of the procedures," Davis v. Hernandez, 798 F.3d 290, 295 (5th Cir. 2015). A failure to inform prisoners of disqualifying aspects of the grievance process may render the process so opaque [*8]  as to be unavailable. Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859. The defendants supply two pieces of evidence that purport to show that Wiley was aware of the policy: a previous grievance rejection notice for the same violation of CPP policy and CO Smith's affidavit averring that Wiley was aware of the policy because Wiley received this particular grievance rejection notice. R. 22-1 (June 5, 2017 Grievance Rejection Notice) (Page ID #132); see also R. 22-1 (Smith Affidavit) (Page ID #130). The grievance rejection states vaguely: "You are asking for inappropriate action to be taken," and then in handwriting, "Remove Staff." R. 22-1 (June 5, 2017 Grievance Rejection Notice) (Page ID #132). A reasonable jury could conclude that this two-word, handwritten note did not give Wiley notice of the broad, generally applicable policy. For instance, and in the light most favorable to Wiley, he could not have known based solely on the handwritten note under what circumstances he could not request to remove staff. After all, his earlier grievance pertained to a nurse who was providing him medical care. R. 22-1 (June 5, 2017 Grievance) (Page ID #132). Here, Wiley attempted to grieve assaults by COs. Therefore, the Defendants have not met [*9]  their initial burden to demonstrate that Wiley failed to exhaust using an available grievance procedure such that no reasonable jury could disagree.2 
Relatedly, the apparent interplay of the grievance form and the policy itself is misleading. A grievance scheme is unavailable when it contains "machination[s]" and "misrepresentation[s]," when "officials [have] devise[d] procedural systems . . . in order to 'trip[ ] up all but the most skillful prisoners.'" Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1860 (last alternation in original) (quoting Woodford, 548 U.S. at 102). The grievance form expressly asks inmates to request an action be taken but gives the inmates no directions or restrictions as to the action they may request. Unless inmates are apprised of the policy prohibiting the suggestion of a specific disciplinary action, the grievance form invites disqualifying inmate error. The contradictory, "gotcha" nature of the grievance form and the policy demonstrates a factual dispute as to the availability of the grievance process. Therefore, we cannot say that the defendants have supplied "evidence . . . so powerful that no reasonable jury would be free to disbelieve" that the grievance process was available to Wiley. Surles, 678 F.3d at 455-56 (quoting Cockrel v. Shelby Cty. Sch. Dist., 270 F.3d 1036, 1056 (6th Cir. 2001)).
We are troubled by the suggestion [*10]  of the defendants that a prisoner's grievance can be rejected simply because it seeks as relief the removal of a prison official, particularly when the grievance is otherwise in compliance with the CPP. Moreover, in his grievance, Wiley asked for other, broader relief. Specifically, he requested that the defendants "be held accountable," in addition to being "removed from their positions." R. 22-1 (July 17, 2017 Grievance) (Page ID #135). His request that the defendants "be held accountable" could easily refer to monetary relief, which does not appear to violate the CPP. See CPP 14.6; id. at (II)(J) (setting forth the grievance process). In large part then, Wiley's grievance complied with the CPP. This further demonstrates that a reasonable jury could conclude that the grievance process was unavailable to Wiley because the grievance officers sought to reject grievances based only on mere technicalities. See Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1860.3  Thus, the defendants at this stage fail to meet their initial burden.
For these reasons, we REVERSE the district court's judgment, DENY AS MOOT Wiley's motion to appoint appellate counsel, and remand for proceedings consistent with this decision. We note that it appears that [*11]  the appointment of pro bono counsel would be appropriate to guide Wiley through discovery, as well as the complicated issues presented in this case. Moreover, appointment of counsel appears to be warranted because Wiley raises serious, substantial allegations that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by the remaining defendants in this action. See R. 34 (Opinion & Order Denying Mot. to Dismiss at 1-6) (Page ID #228-33).

Dissent




THAPAR, Circuit Judge, dissenting. The Supreme Court recently reminded us that our job is not to "sally forth each day looking for wrongs to right." United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579, 206 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2020) (citation omitted). But here the majority does just that. I respectfully dissent.
I.
As Kentucky prisoner Allen Wiley tells it, he was simply waiting in line to go to dinner when five correctional officers assaulted him. He filed an internal grievance asking that the officers be fired. But that request violated the Kentucky Department of Corrections' rule against requests for specific disciplinary action. See Ky. Dep't of Corrs. Policies & Procedures 14.6 (II)(J)(1)(a)(9) ("An inmate filing a grievance concerning a staff member shall not suggest a specific form of disciplinary action."). The grievance was thus rejected.
Instead [*12]  of amending his grievance to comply with the rule, Wiley went to court and sued the officers, the warden, and the Department of Corrections. See R. 22-1, Page ID 134 (instructing Wiley that he could "resubmit the grievance . . . once it is corrected on a new form within the guidelines of CPP 14.6"). Once in court, the defendants pointed out the obvious: Wiley had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 95, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006) (explaining that exhaustion requires compliance with the grievance system's "critical procedural rules"). So the district court correctly granted them summary judgment.
Inmates "are required to follow [prison] procedures to the letter." Risher v. Lappin, 639 F.3d 236, 241 (6th Cir. 2011). There are no "minimum standards" for these procedural rules. Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1858, 195 L. Ed. 2d 117 (2016); see Woodford, 548 U.S. at 85; Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524, 122 S. Ct. 983, 152 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2002). Whether or not we like them, we must respect them. And the Supreme Court has made clear that prisons, not the PLRA (or courts applying it), dictate inmate-grievance procedures. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007) ("[I]t is the prison's requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion."). Put simply, the prisons make the grievance-procedure rules; we just ask whether they were satisfied.
The only "exception" to this exhaustion [*13]  requirement is when a grievance process is "unavailable"—that is, "incapable of use"—to a prisoner. Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1858-59. But this carveout does not help Wiley. His pro se brief (liberally construed) contains two related arguments for why he could not comply with the no-specific-action rule: (1) the grievance policies are kept in the prison's legal office and are not always available for examination; and (2) the grievance forms do not specifically recite the no-specific-action rule. See United States v. Kuehne, 547 F.3d 667, 693 n.10 (6th Cir. 2008) (affording a pro se appellate brief a liberal construction). Neither is compelling. As for the first, even the majority disregards it, rightly observing that there is no record evidence on point. See Maj. Order at 5 n.2. And as for the second, "[a] plaintiff's failure to exhaust cannot be excused by his ignorance of . . . the grievance policy"—or even by a reasonable misunderstanding of that policy. Napier v. Laurel Cty., 636 F.3d 218, 221 n.2 (6th Cir. 2011); see Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1858. It follows that a prisoner is not entitled to affirmative instruction on the correct method of filing a grievance. In short, neither of Wiley's arguments succeeds.
That should be the end of this case.
II.
But the majority holds that Wiley's claim can go forward. Why? The majority offers three rationales. None justifies [*14]  reversal.
A.
The lead argument amounts to the untenable proposition that the prison was indeed required to affirmatively instruct Wiley about the no-specific-action rule. First, the majority suggests that Wiley may have lacked "a fair, reasonable opportunity to apprise himself of the procedures." Maj. Order at 5 (quoting Davis v. Hernandez, 798 F.3d 290, 295 (5th Cir. 2015)). Then, it cites Ross for the proposition that a prison's "failure to inform" an inmate of disqualifying procedural rules "may render the process so opaque as to be unavailable." Id. (citing Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859). Finally, it determines that this standard is met here because Wiley may have misconstrued the no-specific-action rule. Id. The takeaway: a prisoner cannot be required to follow a rule that the prison never affirmatively explained to him.
Ross says no such thing. There, the Court explained that administrative remedies are unavailable if a prison's procedures are "essentially unknowable," i.e., "so opaque" that "no ordinary prisoner can discern or navigate" them. Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859 (citation omitted). That stands in sharp contrast to the rationale for reversing here: Wiley might not have known, or might have failed to understand, the procedure. Compare Maj. Order at 5, with Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859 (stating that the "essentially [*15]  unknowable" standard is "a significantly higher bar" than asking whether a rule was "sufficiently 'plain' as to preclude any reasonable mistake or debate").
Even on its own terms, the analysis is unpersuasive. Wiley had previously filed another grievance in which he requested removal of a nurse; it was rejected because asking to "[r]emove staff" was an "inappropriate action" to ask for. R. 22-1, Page ID 132. We are told that "in the light most favorable to Wiley," he might have thought that this statement from prison officials—you cannot ask to have staff removed—applied to nurses but not correctional officers. Maj. Order at 5. Based on what, exactly? This is just the kind of "metaphysical doubt" that should not preclude summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). More fundamentally, "[w]hen an administrative process is susceptible of multiple reasonable interpretations, Congress has determined that the inmate should err on the side of exhaustion." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859.
But that is not all. The Department not only told Wiley why his grievance was rejected, it explicitly invited him to try again. R. 22-1, Page ID 134; cf. George v. Seabold, 909 F.2d 157, 160 (6th Cir. 1990) (finding that a state prisoner had not exhausted state-court remedies because "the Kentucky Court of Appeals [*16]  appears willing, in the interest of justice, to give defendant another chance" to seek relief). If this is a byzantine process, one wonders what doesn't amount to a "gotcha" trap for the average prisoner. Maj. Order at 6.
B.
The majority evidently believes that the previous argument is enough to reverse the district court. See Maj. Order at 5 ("Therefore, the Defendants have not met their [summary-judgment] burden . . . ."). Even so, it offers two additional theories for why the grievance process was unavailable: (1) the grievance form is unclear and thus creates a trap for the unwary prisoner; and (2) Wiley's grievance otherwise complied with Department rules. Id. at 6.
As for the grievance form's supposed lack of clarity, it was incumbent on Wiley to learn the rules and, when in doubt, to "err on the side of exhaustion." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859; Napier, 636 F.3d at 221 n.2. In any event, he was previously told that requesting staff be removed was sufficient grounds to reject a grievance; this is hardly the type of "machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation" designed to "thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1860; cf. Maj. Op. at 6. As for Wiley's partial compliance, this does not suffice under the PLRA. See Woodford, 548 U.S. at 93 (holding [*17]  that "the PLRA exhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion"); Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1857 ("Time and again, this Court has . . . refus[ed] to add unwritten limits onto" the "rigorous textual requirements" of "mandatory exhaustion statutes like the PLRA."); cf. Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 108, 120 S. Ct. 2080, 147 L. Ed. 2d 80 (2000) (explaining that "courts reviewing agency action regularly ensure against the bypassing of [applicable exhaustion] requirement[s] by refusing to consider unexhausted issues"). The majority provides no contrary authority.
III.
Setting aside the merits of these two alternative theories, I would not consider them for the simple reason that Wiley never raised them. See, e.g., Geboy v. Brigano, 489 F.3d 752, 767 (6th Cir. 2007) (stating that even pro se appellants must fairly raise and develop arguments before this court). True, Wiley says he "made a good faith effort to try filing his grievance" and points out that the grievance form "does not advise the filer on what remedies to request." Appellant Br. at 4. But Wiley does not develop these bare-bones factual assertions into anything resembling the majority's legal arguments. He says nothing about the "interplay" of the grievance form and the no-specific-action rule. Maj. Order at 6. Nor does he complain that the rule is "troubl[ing]" or a "mere technicalit[y]" [*18]  unworthy of this court's respect. Id. Just this year the Supreme Court warned lower courts against creating arguments for litigants who fail to raise them. See Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. at 1579. I would heed that warning.
I respectfully dissent.
