Opinion




 ORDER
Petitioner Roberto Carlos Guerrero Ramirez, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, seeks review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge's (IJ) decision denying him asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. He moves to stay his removal pending review. The Attorney General opposes the motion.
We have the discretion to grant a stay of removal pending consideration of a petition for review. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(3)(B). Four factors guide our decision: (1) whether the petitioner "has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits"; (2) whether he "will be irreparably injured absent a stay"; (3) "whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding"; and (4) "where the public interest lies." Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 173 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776, 107 S. Ct. 2113, 95 L. Ed. 2d 724 (1987)). The four factors "are [*2]  not prerequisites that must be met, but are interrelated considerations that must be balanced together." Mich. Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir. 1991). "The first two factors . . . are the most critical." Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. "The third and fourth factors merge when the Government is the opposing party. While the grant of a stay is governed by legal standards, it is ultimately subject to a court's discretion." Slyusar v. Holder, 740 F.3d 1068, 1074 (6th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).
Guerrero Ramirez argues that he is likely to succeed on the merits because the IJ and BIA erroneously denied him relief based on his failure to provide corroborating evidence. "The BIA's decisions are final agency determinations for purposes of judicial review, and we are also empowered to review the IJ's opinion to the extent that the BIA adopts that opinion." Gaye v. Lynch, 788 F.3d 519, 526 (6th Cir. 2015). "Where the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence." 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). "[A]n IJ may not rule against a petitioner on the basis of his failure to produce corroborative evidence when he has been given no opportunity to explain its absence." Guzman-Vazquez v. Barr, 959 F.3d 253, 263 (6th Cir. 2020). "The question here is whether the IJ in fact 'speculated [*3]  as to the availability of witness testimony' and other corroborative evidence without giving [Guerrero Ramirez] an opportunity to explain the unavailability of such corroboration." Id.
Acknowledging this precedent, the government argues that Guerrero Ramirez did have such an opportunity. For support, the government points to an exchange from the hearing in which the government asked Guerrero Ramirez if he could provide corroboration of his testimony. Guerrero Ramirez responded, "Yes. There are letters from people in my country from people who know what I—everything that I'm living." A.R. at 175. The exchange then turned to a new topic. The IJ determined that Guerrero Ramirez "was generally credible" but that "he failed to corroborate significant details from his testimony with sufficient evidence." A.R. at 85. The IJ determined that a letter from a friend submitted by Guerrero Ramirez lacked detail and faulted him for failing to provide "evidence of statements from friends or family in Nicaragua corroborating his [protest] participation and persecution by the government." Id. But Guerrero Ramirez was never asked about the absence of statements from additional witnesses and the IJ speculated as to their [*4]  availability. The law requires the IJ to substantively consider whether the applicant can reasonably obtain the relevant evidence. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). The IJ did not make such a consideration. And "an IJ may not require corroborative evidence without giving the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence." Guzman-Vazquez, 959 F.3d at 261. The IJ did not give Guerrero Ramirez such an opportunity. An opportunity to provide one piece of evidence is not an opportunity to explain the absence of all additional evidence the IJ might seek.
Further, Guerrero Ramirez is likely to succeed on his claim that the IJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Guerrero Ramirez submitted a list of names, including his own, posted to social media. The IJ determined that "[t]here is no evidence indicating that the government intended to imprison or persecute those mentioned on the list." A.R. at 87. However, Guerrero Ramirez testified that those on the list would be imprisoned without due process and submitted news articles and a human rights report lending support to his testimony. The IJ also determined that Guerrero Ramirez "failed to provide any evidence corroborating [his] assertion" that the government would persecute him because of an actual [*5]  or imputed political opinion. A.R. at 88. Again, however, Guerrero Ramirez submitted relevant articles, a human rights report, a list of names of those involved in anti-government protests, and a letter from a friend indicating that those on the list would be "capture[d] and taken to [a] jail named chipotle" and that police had been searching for Guerrero Ramirez. A.R. 242. Therefore, Guerrero Ramirez has shown a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of his argument that the IJ's conclusion that he "failed to establish that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground," A.R. 88, was not "supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole," Juan Antonio v. Barr, 959 F.3d 778, 788 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Zhao v. Holder, 569 F.3d 238, 247 (6th Cir. 2009)), and that the record as a whole compels the opposite conclusion, See Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, 453 F.3d 743, 749 (6th Cir. 2006).
Guerrero Ramirez "satisfies the second prong of the test, as removal would be an irreparable injury. As to the third and fourth prongs, which are merged in the instant case, the government would not be substantially injured by the grant of a stay." Slyusar, 740 F.3d at 1074. Further, "the public certainly has an interest in 'preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, particularly [*6]  to countries where they are likely to face substantial harm.'" Id. (quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 436).
The motion for a stay of removal is GRANTED. This order does not stay the petitioner's reporting requirements and other conditions of supervision imposed by the United States Department of Homeland Security.

Dissent




THAPAR, J., dissenting.
The executive branch has broad power to enforce our nation's immigration laws. As a result, the Supreme Court has reminded us that we must be "highly deferential" to the executive's enforcement decisions—lest we arrogate the executive's power as our own. Nasrallah v. Barr, 140 S. Ct. 1683, 1692, 207 L. Ed. 2d 111 (2020). Because the executive branch acted within its broad discretion to deny the asylum claim at issue here, I respectfully dissent.
Roberto Carlos Guerrero Ramirez illegally entered the United States by swimming across the Rio Grande River near Eagle Pass, Texas. Border Patrol agents quickly detained him. Initially, Guerrero refused to answer the officers' questions. But he soon sought asylum, claiming he would face persecution if deported to Nicaragua (his native country).
An immigration judge then held a hearing on Guerrero's asylum request. The judge determined that, although Guerrero's testimony seemed credible, he "should provide [*7]  evidence that corroborate[d] [his] testimony." 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). It was thus Guerrero's burden to "provide" corroborative evidence or to show that he could not "reasonably obtain the evidence." Id.; see also Gaye v. Lynch, 788 F.3d 519, 529-30 (6th Cir. 2015).
During his asylum hearing, Guerrero neither provided corroborative evidence nor explained why it was not reasonably obtainable—despite having ample opportunity to do so. See, e.g., A.R. 155-56, 170-71.1  He thus failed to carry his burden under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). And as a result, the immigration judge correctly rejected his asylum application, and the Board of Immigration Appeals correctly affirmed.
Guerrero now argues (among other things) that the immigration judge failed to give him sufficient notice regarding the corroborative evidence that he should have submitted. But in Gaye, we squarely held that "federal law does not entitle illegal aliens to notice from the Immigration Court as to what sort of evidence the alien must produce to carry his burden." 788 F.3d at 530. Rather, the immigration judge may rule on the adequacy of an applicant's corroborative evidence after considering the record in its entirety. See id. at 529-30. Since Guerrero's argument runs headfirst into Gaye, his claim is unlikely to succeed on the merits. [*8] 
The majority reaches the opposite conclusion for two reasons. First, the majority relies on Guzman-Vazquez v. Barr, which held that before an immigration judge rules against a petitioner "on the basis of his failure to produce corroborative evidence," the petitioner must have "an opportunity to explain its absence." 959 F.3d 253, 263 (6th Cir. 2020). But that holding can't be reconciled with Gaye. See id. at 275 (Murphy, J., dissenting) ("The majority's new rule conflicts with Gaye's reading of the statutory text and structure."). And in our circuit, the first-in-time decision controls. See Salmi v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1985).
Second, the majority nitpicks the immigration judge's factual findings. It points to evidence that Guerrero claims corroborates his assertions and then takes issue with the immigration judge for saying that "no evidence" supported those assertions. The problem with this is that the immigration judge explained why the very evidence the majority points to was not convincing. See A.R. 83-84. And we may not reject those explanations "unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to" do so. Nasrallah, 140 S. Ct. at 1692 (emphasis added). The majority does not even try to explain how that "highly deferential" standard is satisfied here. Id.
For these reasons, I respectfully [*9]  dissent from the stay order.
