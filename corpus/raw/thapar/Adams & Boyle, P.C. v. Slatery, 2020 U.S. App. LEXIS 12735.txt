Opinion




 ORDER
Defendants Governor Bill Lee, Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery, III, and others in their official capacities (collectively "the State") appeal the district court's order preliminarily enjoining them from enforcing Tennessee Executive Order ("EO") 25 titled "An Order to Reduce the Spread of COVID-19 by Limiting Non-Emergency [*3]  Healthcare Procedures," as applied to procedural abortions. The State has filed an emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction and requests a temporary administrative stay while we consider its emergency motion. The plaintiffs have not yet had an opportunity to respond.
We are not persuaded that this is the type of emergency situation that justifies the grant of an administrative stay. If we ultimately grant the State's motion for a stay, the State can easily restore EO-25 as it applies to procedural abortions. On the other hand, temporarily stopping the preliminary injunction from taking effect will have serious consequences for women who will soon be past the legal limit for a procedural abortion in Tennessee.
The motion for a temporary administrative stay is DENIED. We will consider the merits of a stay when briefing on the stay motion is completed.

Dissent




THAPAR, J., dissenting.
Like doctors, judges should follow the maxim "first, do no harm." Three days ago, the district court broadly enjoined an executive order from the Governor of Tennessee meant to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The court reasoned that this order violates the right of women in Tennessee to obtain a pre-viability [*4]  abortion. But in doing so, the court made two critical errors: (1) it failed to point to specific evidence that a temporary delay would deprive any woman of her right to obtain an abortion, and (2) it failed to apply (or even acknowledge) Supreme Court precedent "governing emergency exercises of state authority during a public health crisis." In re Abbott, No. 20-50264, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 10893, 2020 WL 1685929, at *5 (5th Cir. Apr. 7, 2020) (citing Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S. Ct. 358, 49 L. Ed. 643 (1905)). And while we take time to review this case, the district court's injunction places lives in jeopardy. Given these serious concerns, I would grant the State's request for a temporary administrative stay pending our review of its stay motion.
