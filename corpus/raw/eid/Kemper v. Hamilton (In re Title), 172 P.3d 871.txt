Syllabus




The Title Board set the title, ballot title, and submission clause for proposed Initiative 2007-2008, # 17, entitled "New State Department and Elected Board for Environmental Conservation." The Supreme Court reverses the action of the Title Board in setting the title, ballot title, and submission clause for Initiative 2007-2008, # 17.
The Supreme Court holds that the initiative violates the single subject requirement of Colorado Constitution article V, section 1(5.5). It determines that the initiative proposes a public trust standard in addition to creating a new executive department of state government and that these are multiple subjects under the precedent of In re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary Pertaining to a Proposed Initiative "Public Rights in Waters II" ("Waters II"), 898 P.2d 1076 (Colo. 1995).
Accordingly, the Supreme Court reverses the action of the Title Board and remands this matter with directions to strike the titles and return the initiative to its proponents.

Opinion




 [*872]  EN BANC
In this appeal pursuant to section 1-40-107(2), C.R.S. (2007), two registered electors, Douglas Kemper and Stuart Sanderson (collectively, "Kemper"), challenge the action of the Title Board in setting the title, ballot title, and submission clause ("titles") for proposed Initiative 2007-2008 # 17 (unofficially captioned by legislative staff, for tracking purposes, "New State Department and Elected Board for Public Resource Conservation"). 1  
The initiative's proponents contend that the measure proposes only the creation of a new Colorado Department of Environmental Conservation with a mission  [**3] of "conservation stewardship." Kemper asserts that the measure goes beyond establishing a new environmental department and supplying it with a mission statement for conservation stewardship; instead, the initiative, in sections 2 and 7, sets forth a mandatory public trust standard for agency decision-making whereby conflicts between "economic interest" and "public ownership and public conservation values in lands, waters, public resources, and wildlife," must always be resolved in favor of "public ownerships and public values."
The initiative's proponents have submitted a written statement characterizing their own testimony before the Title Board as "definitively and succinctly stat[ing] that there has been no attempt in the article XXX proposal to establish a public trust doctrine." 2  However, Kemper contends that the language of the measure does, in fact, propose a public trust standard conjoined with the creation of a new environmental department, thereby creating a multiple subject violation contrary to our decision in In re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary Pertaining to a Proposed Initiative "Public Rights in Waters II" ("Waters II"), 898 P.2d 1076, 1078-79 (Colo. 1995).  [**4] 
Thus, a central point of contention in this appeal is whether the initiative contains a proposal to establish a public trust standard for agency decision-making. We agree with Kemper that the initiative contains the additional subject of a public trust standard, not simply the subject of a new environmental department with a conservation stewardship mission. We conclude that our decision in Waters II controls our decision in this case  [*873]  and requires that the public trust standard proposed in this initiative be made in a single subject initiative. Accordingly, we reverse the action of the Title Board and remand this case to it  [**5] with directions to strike the titles and return the initiative to its proponents. 3  
 I.  
Initiative # 17's Proposal
On June 6, 2007, the Title Board conducted a public meeting on Initiative 2007-2008 # 17, pursuant to section 1-40-106(1), C.R.S. (2007). It designated and fixed a title, ballot title, and submission clause for the initiative. Kemper filed a Motion for Rehearing. At a subsequent public meeting, the Title Board denied Kemper's motion, whereupon Kemper initiated this original proceeding for review of the Title Board's action.
The initiative proposes ten single-spaced pages of new text, adding section XXX to the Colorado Constitution. It  [**6] contains eleven provisions applicable to numerous agencies that are currently assigned to the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Health and Environment, and the Governor's Office. The initiative would transfer to the new Department of Environmental Conservation the following existing programs, divisions, boards, and commissions: Colorado Natural Areas Program; Colorado Water Conservation Board; Colorado Division of Forestry; Colorado Division of State Parks; Colorado Water Quality Control Division; Colorado Division of Wildlife; Colorado Land Use Commission; Colorado Captive Wildlife and Alternative Livestock Board; the State Board of Land Commissioners; Great Outdoors Colorado Program; State Board of the Great Outdoors Colorado Trust Fund; Hazardous Waste Commission; Colorado Land Use Commission; Colorado Natural Areas Council; Colorado Board of Parks and Outdoor Recreation; Pollution Prevention Advisory Board; Colorado Water Conservation Board; Colorado Water Quality Control Commission; Wildlands and Urban Interface Wildlife Working Group; Colorado Wildlife Commission; and Colorado Joint Review Process. The initiative also includes language that would insert a public  [**7] trust standard into agency decision-making.
 II.
We agree with Kemper that the initiative contains the additional subject of a public trust standard, not simply the subject of a new environmental department with a conservation stewardship mission. We conclude that our decision in Waters II controls our decision in this case and requires that the public trust standard contained in the language of this initiative be proposed in a single subject initiative.
 A.  
Standard of Review
In 1994, the Colorado voters adopted the single subject matter requirement of article V, section 1(5.5). This constitutional requirement and the Title Board's enabling statute, § 1-40-106.5(1)(a), C.R.S. (2007), provide that a proposed initiative must be "clearly expressed." The Constitution and the statute prohibit initiatives from containing two or more separate and discrete subjects that are not dependent upon or necessarily connected with each other. Waters II, 898 P.2d 1076, 1078-79; see also In re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary for Proposed Initiative 2001-02 # 43, 46 P.3d 438, 441-42 (Colo. 2002).
Further, one of the purposes of the single subject requirement is to apprise voters of the subject  [**8] of each measure, so that surreptitious measures that could result in voter surprise or fraud are not placed on the ballot. Id. at 441; see also § 1-40-106.5(1)(e)(II), C.R.S. (2007). At first glance, the concept of a single subject appears straightforward; however, an initiative with  [*874]  multiple subjects may be improperly offered as a single subject by stating the subject in broad terms. In re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary 2005-2006 # 55, 138 P.3d 273, 274 (Colo. 2006).
Implementing provisions that are directly tied to an initiative's central focus are not separate subjects. In re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary for 1999-2000 # 258(A), 4 P.3d 1094, 1097 (Colo. 2000). While we do not determine an initiative's efficacy, construction, or future application, we must examine the proposal sufficiently to enable review of the Title Board's action. Id. at 1097-98. We apply the general rules of statutory construction and accord the language of the measure its plain meaning. In re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary for 2005-2006 # 75, 138 P.3d 267, 271 (Colo. 2006).
 B.  
This Initiative Proposes a Public Trust Standard, Not Simply a New Environmental  [**9] Department with a Conservation Stewardship Mission
At first glance, this initiative may seem to propose only the creation of an environmental conservation department with a conservation stewardship mission. However, a plain reading of the initiative's language also reveals the inclusion of a public trust standard for agency decision-making.
Section 7 of the initiative assigns to the new environmental department a priority to "steward and protect the public ownership and public conservation values in lands, waters, public resources, and wildlife." Standing alone, this language can be viewed as merely assigning a mission to the new department. However, additional language in section 7 and section 2 of the initiative creates a new and mandatory public trust standard for agency decision-making applicable to existing divisions, programs, boards, and commissions transferred from the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Health and the Environment, and the Governor's Office.
First, the initiative utilizes the words "[t]rust responsibilities" in the lead lines of section 7. After stating the new department's mission, section 7 sets forth a mandatory public trust standard, whereby  [**10] conflicts between "economic interest" and "public ownership and public conservation values in lands, waters, public resources, and wildlife" shall be resolved in favor of "public ownerships and public values."
Section 7 enunciates this new public trust standard as follows:
Trust responsibilities of the Colorado department of environmental conservation. (1) The Colorado Department of Environmental Conservation is created by the people of the state of Colorado to ensure public resource conservation stewardship, and in connection therewith, the Colorado Department of Environmental Conservation, and the elected members of the Board of Commissioners of the Colorado Department of Environmental Conservation, shall have, as priority, the responsibility to steward and protect the public ownership and public conservation values in lands, waters, public resources, and wildlife. Conflict between economic interest and conservation stewardship responsibilities to, and for, the public's resources and resource conservation values shall be resolved in favor of public ownerships and public values.
(emphasis added).
Section 2 of the initiative mandates that, in the event of conflict with other constitutional  [**11] provisions, the provisions of the new article XXX preempt existing constitutional provisions. Specifically, Section 2 states:
Should conflict with other Colorado constitutional provisions arise hereafter, provisions within Article XXX shall be held dominant over other, previous constitutional provisions.
(emphasis added).
Thus, in providing for the resolution of economic interest conflicts in favor of public ownerships and public values in every instance, sections 2 and 7 mandate a public trust standard. This language goes beyond establishing a mission of conservation stewardship for the new environmental department  [*875]  into constitutionally mandating a controlling legal standard.
 C.
Our Decision in Waters II Controls
The public trust standard this initiative proposes is a variation on a subject we have addressed in prior ballot title cases. In Waters II, the proposed public trust would have required the state to "adopt and defend a strong public trust doctrine regarding the public's rights and ownerships in and of the waters in Colorado." 898 P.2d at 1077 n.1. Because the public trust standard was joined with a proposal for reforming water district rules, we determined that the initiative contained  [**12] more than a single subject in violation of the single subject requirement of article V, section 1(5.5) of the Colorado Constitution.
Just as the initiative in Waters II improperly paired the reformation of water district rules with the separate and discrete subject of the creation of a public trust standard, so too does this initiative improperly pair the creation of a new environmental department with the separate and discrete subject of the creation of a public trust standard.
In other cases, we have upheld the action of the Title Board in setting the titles when the subject of creating a public trust standard was not paired with a separate and discrete subject in a proposed initiative. See In Re Title Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary 1996 # 6 ("Hufford"), 917 P.2d 1277 (Colo. 1996); In Re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary for Proposed Initiative on Water Rights ("Swingle"), 877 P.2d 321 (Colo. 1994).
For instance, in Hufford, the initiative at issue proposed that the "State of Colorado shall adopt, and defend, a public trust doctrine to protect the public's rights and ownerships in and of the waters in Colorado, and to protect the natural environment." 917 P.2d at 1278 n.2.  [**13] Additionally, in Swingle, the initiative we reviewed proposed the public trust language of the initiative in Hufford and added a provision requiring that "the State of Colorado protect and defend the publics' [sic] interests in waters from unwarranted or otherwise narrow definitions of its waters as private property." 877 P.2d at 324.
The public trust language of the initiative now before us only recasts the words of the prior initiatives we considered in Waters II, Hufford, and Swingle. The operative precepts "trust responsibility" for "public ownership" and "public values" in "water" is the same in this case as in Waters II, Hufford, and Swingle. This initiative adds "lands, public resources, and wildlife" to the trust responsibility and, most significantly, enunciates a mandatory constitutionally preemptive legal standard whereby conflicts between "economic interest" and "public ownership and public conservation values in lands, waters, public resources, and wildlife," shall be resolved in favor of "public ownerships and public values."
In this initiative, the public trust standard subject is paired with the subject of reorganizing existing natural resource and environmental protection  [**14] divisions, programs, boards, and commissions, and these are separate and discrete subjects that are not dependent upon or necessarily connected with each other. Similarly, we held in Waters II, 898 P.2d 1076, that the reform of water district rules and the creation of a public trust standard were separate and discrete subjects that were not dependent upon or necessarily connected with each other.
An initiative that joins multiple subjects poses the danger of voter surprise and fraud occasioned by the inadvertent passage of a surreptitious provision coiled up in the folds of a complex initiative. In Re Title, Ballot Title & Submission Clause, & Summary for 2001-02 # 43, 46 P.3d at 442. We must examine sufficiently an initiative's central theme to determine whether it contains hidden purposes under a broad theme. In re Proposed Initiative for 2005-2006 # 55, 138 P.3d 273, 279 (Colo. 1995).
The initiative before us today is complex and subtly worded. However, just as "water" was too broad a theme in Waters II, 898 P.2d 1080, to unite multiple subjects into a single subject, so do "environmental conservation" and "conservation stewardship" fail  [*876]  to suffice here. Despite the statement of the  [**15] initiative's proponents that the initiative simply creates a new environmental department with a conservation stewardship mission, a plain reading of the initiative reveals that it superimposes onto existing constitutional and statutory provisions the duty to resolve every conflict between "economic interests" and "public ownership or public values" in favor of "public ownership or public values."
The public trust standard contained in this initiative is coiled in the folds of the measure, contrary to our holding in Waters II, 898 P.2d at 1080. What appears to be a simple proposal to reorganize and consolidate existing environmental protection and natural resource conservation agencies for the purpose of efficiency and carrying out their assigned responsibilities is conjoined with the creation of a public trust standard, in violation of the single subject requirement of article V, section 1(5.5) of the Colorado Constitution.

Accordingly, we reverse the Board's action and remand this matter with directions to strike the titles and return the initiative to its proponents.

Dissent




JUSTICE EID, dissenting.
Today the  [**16] majority invalidates, under the single subject requirement, 1  proposed Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17, which would create a new state department of environmental conservation. The new department's mission would be defined as "ensur[ing] public resource conservation stewardship." Maj. op. at 20 (Appendix B). According to the majority, the initiative's proponents can create a new department, but they cannot -- without running afoul of the single subject requirement -- give that department a mission. In my view, the single subject requirement does not put the initiative's proponents to such a choice. That requirement is easily satisfied in this case because the new department's "conservation stewardship" mission is sufficiently connected to the creation of the department itself. Because the majority finds otherwise, I respectfully dissent from its opinion. 
 I.
The majority makes two fundamental mistakes. First, it misinterprets the text of proposed Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 to find that it imposes a "public trust" doctrine on Colorado natural resources law. Yet on its face, the initiative merely describes the "conservation stewardship" mission that the proposed new department would carry out. Second, the majority finds that the initiative fails under our precedent of Waters II because there is an insufficient connection between the new department and its mission of "conservation stewardship." There is a sufficient connection here, however, because the former will carry out the latter. In my view, Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 passes muster under the single subject requirement because it contains a single, easily identifiable subject -- namely, the creation of a new department of environmental conservation.
 A.
The majority concludes that proposed Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 imposes  [**18] a "public trust" doctrine on Colorado natural resources law. Maj. op. at 10. It focuses on section 7 of the initiative, which provides:
The Colorado Department of Environmental Conservation is created by the people of the state of Colorado to ensure public resource conservation stewardship, and in connection therewith, the Colorado Department of Environmental Conservation, and the elected members of the Board of Commissioners of the Colorado Department  [*877]  of Environmental Conservation, shall have, as priority, the responsibilities to steward and protect the public ownership and public conservation values in lands, waters, public resources, and wildlife. Conflict between economic interest and conservation stewardship responsibilities to, and for, the public's resources and resource conservation values shall be resolved in favor of public ownerships and public values.
Id. at 20 (Appendix B) (emphasis added).
This section describes the mission of the department (namely, to "ensure public resource conservation stewardship") and its "priority" (namely, the responsibility to "steward and protect the public ownership and public conservation values" in natural resources). The final "conflict" sentence  [**19] states that the department must place conservation stewardship over economic concerns. When read in context, this "conflict" language is simply a further description of the department's mission and priorities, not -- as the majority concludes -- a free-standing "controlling legal standard" governing all of Colorado natural resources law. See id. at 10.
We have repeatedly held that it is not our role at this stage to construe the proposed initiative. See, e.g., In re Proposed Initiative for 2001-2002 No. 43, 46 P.3d 438, 443 (Colo. 2002); In re Proposed Initiatives for 2001-2002 Nos. 21 & 22, 44 P.3d 213, 215-16 (Colo. 2002); In re Proposed Initiative for 1999-2000 No. 200A, 992 P.2d 27, 30 (Colo. 2000). This is a matter "for judicial determination in a proper case should the voters approve the initiative." In re Proposed Initiative for 1999-2000 No. 200A,992 P.2d at 30. Nevertheless, the majority strays into construction in this case by giving the initiative's "conflict" language an extraordinarily broad interpretation -- an interpretation that goes significantly beyond the plain language of the initiative itself.
For support of its interpretation, the majority cites to the fact that  [**20] prior proposed initiatives have imposed a public trust doctrine. Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17, it concludes, is simply a "variation" of those prior initiatives. Maj. op. at 10. Yet this sort of analysis ignores critical differences between the language used in the prior initiatives and the language used in the proposed initiative we consider today. In Waters II, for example, the proposed initiative would have required "the State of Colorado [to] adopt and defend a strong public trust doctrine regarding the public's rights and ownerships in and of the waters in Colorado." In re Proposed Initiative "Public Rights in Waters II, 898 P.2d 1076, 1077 n.1 (Colo. 1995) (emphasis added). Similarly, in Hufford, the proposed initiative provided that the "State of Colorado shall adopt, and defend, a public trust doctrine to protect the public's rights and ownerships in and of the waters in Colorado." In re Proposed Initiative "1996-6", 917 P.2d 1277, 1278 n.2 (Colo. 1996) (per curiam) (emphasis added); see also In re Proposed Initiative on Water Rights, 877 P.2d 321, 324 n.3 (Colo. 1994) (requiring the state to "adopt and defend a strong public trust doctrine regarding the publics' [sic] rights  [**21] and ownerships in and of the waters in Colorado") ("Swingle") (emphasis added). These prior initiatives would have required the state to "adopt and defend a strong public trust doctrine." By contrast, Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 does not require the state to "adopt" anything, nor does it employ the phrase "public trust doctrine." Indeed, its language does not purport to change any substantive natural resources law currently on the books.
The majority concludes that Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 merely "recasts the words of the prior initiatives we considered in Waters II, Hufford, and Swingle." Maj. op. at 12. It is true that the initiative uses many of the same words as those prior initiatives, but it leaves some important ones out -- namely, those that would change Colorado natural resources law. While the initiative may use many of the same words that are found in prior initiatives, it does so in the context of defining the mission of the proposed department of environmental conservation, rather than in the context of ordering the state to adopt a significant change in Colorado natural resources law. The majority errs, in my view, by failing to recognize this critical difference.
  [*878]  B.
The  [**22] majority's second error is its conclusion that Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 fails under Waters II because it pairs "conservation stewardship" with a structural change -- that is, the consolidation of existing environmental boards and commissions into a new department. Maj. op. at 12-14. Unlike Waters II, however, there is a sufficient connection in this case between the "conservation stewardship" mission and the new department tasked with pursuing it.
In Waters II, we concluded that there was an insufficient connection between one part of an initiative that imposed election requirements on water districts and a second part that required the state of Colorado to adopt and defend new public trust water rights. 898 P.2d at 1080. We noted that there was no indication "how the election changes would facilitate the development of a 'public trust' doctrine." Id. By contrast, the present case concerns an initiative in which the structural change (i.e., the creation of a new department) is sufficiently linked to the "conservation stewardship" mission, as it is the department that will carry out the mission.
The majority seems to believe that, under Waters II, the "conservation stewardship" mission  [**23] cannot be paired with a structural change of any kind. See, e.g., maj. op. at 11-12. Yet Waters II did not sweep so broadly. The problem in Waters II was that no sufficient link existed between the public trust doctrine and the proposed structural change, not that the doctrine always has to be proposed by itself. Here, the proponents of Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 have provided the very link that we said was missing in Waters II, as the new department is created in order to promote "conservation stewardship."
The majority also cites Waters II for the proposition that concepts such as "water," "environmental conservation," and "conservation stewardship" are too broad to serve as the subject of Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17. Maj. op. at 13. These "subjects" proposed by the majority are simply straw men, however, as the initiative's proponents do not suggest any of them. Instead, the initiative is focused on a much narrower theme -- that is, the creation of the new department of environmental conservation. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, id., it would come as no surprise to voters that a new department of environmental conservation would have "conservation stewardship" as  [**24] its priority.
In its application of the single subject test today, the majority significantly increases the degree of scrutiny to which we subject proposed initiatives. Traditionally, we have stated that there must be a "necessary or proper" connection between the component parts of a proposed initiative. See, e.g., Waters II, 898 P.2d at 1079; In re Proposed Initiatives for 1999-2000 Nos. 227 & 228, 3 P.3d 1, 4 (Colo. 2000); In re Proposed Initiative for 1999-2000 No. 29, 972 P.2d 257, 265 (Colo. 1999); In re Proposed Amendment Adding Paragraph (d) Subsection (8) of Section 20 of Article X, 908 P.2d 125, 128 (Colo. 1995); In re Proposed Amendment Adding Subsection (10) to Section 20 of Article X, 900 P.2d 121, 125 (Colo. 1995). Under the "necessary or proper connection" standard, the single subject requirement is not violated unless an initiative has "at least two distinct and separate purposes which are not dependent upon or connected with each other." Waters II, 898 P.2d at 1078-79; In re Proposed Initiatives for 1999-2000 Nos. 227 & 228, 3 P.3d at 4; In re Proposed Initiative for 1999-2000 No. 29, 972 P.2d at 261; In re Proposed Initiative "1996-6", 917 P.2d at 1279-80; In re Proposed Amendment Adding Paragraph (d) Subsection (8) of Section 20 of Article X, 908 P.2d at 128 [**25] ; In re Proposed Amendment Adding Section 2 to Article VII, 907 P.2d 586, 590 (Colo. 1995); In re Proposed Petition for Amendment Adding Subsection (10) to Section 20 of Article X, 900 P.2d at 125. In this case, it is difficult to see how "conservation stewardship" is not dependent upon or connected with the creation of the new department itself, as the concept would have no existence -- either as a legal standard (as interpreted by the majority) or as a mission (as I would read it) -- without a department to pursue it. In my view, "conservation stewardship" is sufficiently connected with the creation of the new department to meet the single subject  [*879]  requirement as it has been traditionally defined in our caselaw.
The majority comes to the contrary conclusion, stating without elaboration that the new department's mission of "conservation stewardship" is "not dependent upon or necessarily connected with" the creation of the new department. Maj. op. at 12. By this, the majority appears to mean that because it is possible to create a new department without giving it a mission, the mission is not "dependent upon" or "necessarily  [**26] connected with" the new department. In other words, because the initiative could live without the mission provision, it must. The majority's approach requires an initiative's proponents to draw their proposal as narrowly as possible, leaving out components that are sufficiently connected with, but not absolutely necessary to, carrying out the initiative's central theme.
The majority's application of the single subject requirement in this case bears little resemblance to our traditional "necessary or proper" test, which is designed to root out incongruous subjects. See In re Proposed Amendment Adding Subsection (10) to Section 20 of Article X, 900 P.2d at 125 (stating that an initiative's component parts must not be "disconnected or incongruous"). Taking our cue from the legislature, we have recognized that "[t] he single-subject requirement must be liberally construed." In re Proposed Initiative 1997-1998 No. 74, 962 P.2d 927, 929 (Colo. 1998); see also § 1-40-106.5(2), C.R.S. (2007) ("It is the intent of the general assembly that [the single subject requirement] be liberally construed . . . ."). The majority's approach flies in the face of this liberal construction by imposing a new  [**27] level of heightened scrutiny under which all but the narrowest of proposed initiatives will fail.
Today's decision effectively requires the initiative's proponents to accomplish a single goal by proposing two separate initiatives -- one to consolidate existing boards and commissions into a new department, and a second to give that department a mission to promote conservation stewardship. Under the majority's approach, the proponents must be content with a new department without a mission, or a mission without a new department. In my view, the single subject requirement does not require such a choice.
 II.
Our job today is to assess whether Initiative 2007-2008 No. 17 contains more than a single subject. The proposed initiative might be a good idea or a bad idea; we must leave that decision to the voters. In re Proposed Initiative for 2005-2006 No. 55, 138 P.3d 273, 284 (Colo. 2006) (Coats, J., dissenting). Because the proposed initiative before us today does, in my view, contain a single subject, I respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion.
I am authorized to say that JUSTICE RICE and JUSTICE COATS join this dissent.
