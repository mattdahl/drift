Opinion




On further consideration of the granted issues, 64 M.J. 317 (C.A.A.F. 2006), it is ordered that the decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is hereby affirmed as to the findings, but set aside as to the sentence. The record is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force for remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals for consideration of the following issue with respect to the sentence:
WHETHER THE DECISION TO DISAPPROVE TIME SERVED ON MANDATORY SUPERVISED RELEASE AND IMPRISON APPELLANT BEYOND HIS MAXIMUM RELEASE DATE INCREASED APPELLANT'S PUNISHMENT ABOVE THE SENTENCE APPROVED BY THE CONVENING AUTHORITY. SEE UNITED STATES v. PENA, 64 M.J. 259 (C.A.A.F. 2007).
Thereafter, Article 67(b), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. § 867(b)(2000), shall apply.

RYAN, Judge (concurring in the result): 
The remand in this case is based on United States v. Pena, 64 M.J. 259 (C.A.A.F. 2007), a case in which I did not participate. There is a potential reading of the Pena decision that gives me pause with respect to the threshold question of jurisdiction. 
Not so long ago the Supreme Court reaffirmed a fundamental  [*2] principle of law: this Court's jurisdiction is "strictly circumscribed" to "act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals." Clinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U.S. 529, 531, 534, 119 S. Ct. 1538, 143 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1999) (citing Article 67(c), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. § 867(c) (2000)). In addressing the limits of this Court's jurisdiction, the Supreme Court further recognized the power of this Court "to compel adherence to its own judgment" when a "military authority attempted to alter a judgment by revising a court-martial finding or sentence to increase the punishment, contrary to the specific provisions of the UCMJ." Goldsmith, 526 U.S. at 536. 
In light of this precedent, it is unclear to me whether and how this Court has jurisdiction under Article 67(c), UCMJ, to take action with regard to something that is not itself part of the findings or adjudged sentence or an alteration of the judgment. Goldsmith, 526 U.S. at 536. On the one hand, Pena appears to recognize this limitation. 64 M.J. at 266 (focusing on whether there is "an increase in the punishment of confinement adjudged  [*3] by the court-martial"). On the other hand, Pena also suggests that this Court has jurisdiction to review "post-trial confinement and release conditions on direct appeal[,] . . . limited to the impact of such conditions on the findings and the sentence." 64 M.J. at 264. I am concerned that this latter statement may be read to sweep more broadly than our legislative mandate. 
A brief review of the Mandatory Supervised Release Program (MSRP) that Pena complained of heightens the reservation I have about the breadth of this statement. Pena complained that:
he was unable to stop in Colorado to ship his household goods to Illinois, that he incurred a ten dollar per week expenditure for transportation to the sex offender treatment program, that he was required to attend Alcoholic Anonymous classes three times a week at night and sex offender treatment classes once a week during the day, that he had various other appointments and a requirement to give a urine sample on short notice every two weeks, and that the conditions of mandatory supervision left him unable to find work to support his family.
Id. 
I do not see how these complaints involve an alteration of the adjudged sentence. This Court  [*4] held that Pena failed to show that his "burdens [were] such that they resulted in an increase in the punishment of confinement adjudged by the court-martial." Id. at 266. But that statement by this Court could be read as support for the proposition that determining whether the MSRP results in an increase in the punishment of confinement is not limited to an actual alteration of the adjudged sentence, but includes assessments "about the personal, psychological, economic, and family impact" of a MSRP on the party "appealing the sentence." Id. It is unclear to me how social, family, and psychological issues constitute an alteration of an adjudged sentence. It is also unclear to me how we have the power to review collateral consequences of the MSRP, a program administered by executive branch officials on the Clemency and Parole Board. See Goldsmith, 526 U.S. at 536. 
It remains to be seen whether my reservation is warranted. Regardless, a summary remand with no briefing on the jurisdictional issue is not the proper vehicle to address the issue. Consequently, I join the Court's disposition here today. But I am open to revisiting the issue, as necessary, in an appropriate case.
