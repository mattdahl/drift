 [**281]  Justice Himonas, opinion of the Court:
 INTRODUCTION
 [*P1]  This is an appeal from a parental-rights termination order entered in the district court. On November 24, 2014, the district court terminated L.E.S.'s parental rights with respect to K.A.S., making K.A.S. legally available for adoption by her stepfather, C.D.M. L.E.S. appealed the termination order to the Utah Court of Appeals, which subsequently certified the case for transfer to the Utah Supreme Court. The issues presented on appeal are a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and claims to the right to counsel under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and under the due process clause of the Utah Constitution. [***2]  For reasons explained below, we hold that the denial of counsel violated L.E.S.'s federal due process rights and reverse and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
 BACKGROUND
 [*P2]  On or about September 23, 2013, C.D.M. and M.K.M. filed a petition for adoption in Uintah County, Utah. C.D.M. sought to adopt his stepdaughter, K.A.S., who was born in 2008. L.E.S., K.A.S.'s biological father, was served with a Notice of Adoption Proceedings on September 23, 2013, requiring him to respond within thirty days if he intended to intervene in or contest the adoption. On or about October 2, 2013, L.E.S., acting pro se, gave notice that he contested the adoption. C.D.M. and M.K.M. then moved to terminate L.E.S.'s parental rights.
 [*P3]  The case was set for trial for termination of parental rights on December 10, 2013. M.K.M. was present with counsel. L.E.S. was present in custody, pro se, having been transported from the Uintah County Jail, where he was incarcerated at the time. Upon questioning L.E.S. about his income and assets, the district court found that he "would qualify for court appointed counsel if this were in the Juvenile Court but question[ed] whether [that statutory right to court-appointed [***3]  counsel] applies to [the] District Court."1  The district court discussed L.E.S.'s right to counsel with Deputy County Attorney Michael Drechsel, who "agreed that Uintah County would be obligated to pay for an attorney to represent the indigent father." Based on Mr. Drechsel's input, the district court appointed counsel for L.E.S.
 [*P4]  On January 24, 2014, Mr. Drechsel filed a motion to intervene on behalf of Uintah County, asserting that his representations "were made in error and contrary to law" and that there was no right to court-appointed counsel for an indigent party in district court proceedings involving the termination of parental rights. In that motion, he requested that the district court reverse its decision to appoint counsel and that it then dismiss Uintah County from the action. No opposing memoranda were filed by any party. L.E.S.'s court-appointed counsel did not respond or request a hearing on the issue, and L.E.S., because he was represented at the time, did not have an opportunity to oppose the motion pro se. See infra ¶20. On February 19, 2014, the district court granted the motion to intervene, reversing the appointment of counsel.
 [*P5]  [**282]   The district court held a number of [***4]  court conferences over the next few months, during which time L.E.S. unsuccessfully attempted to retain counsel. On April 10, 2014, a status conference was held, and the district court set a telephonic scheduling conference with L.E.S., who was then incarcerated at the Utah State Prison, for April 22, 2014. L.E.S. was also informed that he should retain counsel if he so desired.
 [*P6]  At the April 22, 2014 scheduling conference, L.E.S., participating by telephone, requested additional time to retain counsel.
 [*P7]  An attorney review hearing was held on June 3, 2014, which L.E.S. also attended telephonically. At this hearing, L.E.S. indicated that he "believe[d] his family [was] taking care of his counsel for him but [that he had] not been able to speak with them." The district court set a status conference for June 9, 2014, in order to allow L.E.S. more time to speak with his family.
 [*P8]  At that status conference, where L.E.S. was present from prison, the district court noted that L.E.S. "had difficulty contacting family or counsel due to the prison telephone policies to make arrangement[s] to retain counsel." The district court asked an attorney who was serving as counsel for L.E.S. in a juvenile court case to contact L.E.S.'s [***5]  family in order to "understand where they stand with making counsel arrangements for [L.E.S.] and report back to the [c]ourt." The district court also "ask[ed] the prison to allow [L.E.S.] telephone privileges so he can talk with lawyers and/or family members so this [c]ourt can move this matter along."
 [*P9]  On June 17, 2014, L.E.S.'s juvenile court counsel reported to the district court that L.E.S.'s family was working on obtaining counsel and that they requested additional time. L.E.S.'s sisters were present and requested "notification of all hearings to try and help the[ir] brother due to communication issues with [L.E.S.] in prison."
 [*P10]  Another status conference was held on June 30, 2014. L.E.S. was supposed to attend telephonically but "was not available by telephone due to changes in probation officers at the prison." L.E.S.'s sisters were present and reported that they had talked with a lawyer, Ms. Bradley, who needed to speak with L.E.S. The district court noted that L.E.S. was "to sign a waiver to allow his sisters to have access to court records to help with his defense." The district court scheduled a bench trial for the termination proceeding for September 26, 2014.
 [*P11]  On July 22, 2014, yet another status conference [***6]  was held "to check the status of counsel for [L.E.S.]." Ms. Bradley had talked with L.E.S. on the telephone right before the hearing and requested additional time to review the information from that telephone meeting.
 [*P12]  The next status conference was held on July 29, 2014. L.E.S. attended telephonically and sought to present a verbal motion for continuance, which the district court asked him to file in writing instead.
 [*P13]  L.E.S. filed his written motion for continuance with the district court on August 4, 2014, requesting to have the matter continued until at least April 29, 2015, when he expected to be released. In his motion, L.E.S. indicated, among other things, that the prison would "not allow [him] phone access for any legal reason based on a conflict they have," that he could "not obtain adequate employment and [did] not have any other means available to [him] . . . at the prison that would allow [him] the money to pay for counsel," and that he was "at this time financially incapable of hiring counsel." He represented that he had "one opportunity" to talk with a lawyer but that Ms. Bradley "said she was reluctant to take on the case in fear that because of the [above-mentioned] prison [***7]  policy she would not be able to provide adequate counsel." C.D.M. and M.K.M. opposed the motion for continuance.
 [*P14]  No oral argument was requested on the matter of the motion for continuance, and on September 2, 2014, C.D.M. and M.K.M. requested that the briefs be submitted for a ruling. On September 5, 2014, the district court issued a ruling and order denying the motion for continuance. The district court based its decision on the following reasons: the matter had "been pending since September 23, 2013"; "[m]ultiple status hearings ha[d] been held in an effort to provide [L.E.S.] the opportunity to find counsel";  [**283]  L.E.S. had "had ample time to prepare for the trial, or to obtain counsel to represent him at trial"; and a "permanent living environment and a resolution to these proceedings are in the best interest of the minor child."
 [*P15]  On September 8, 2014, the district court held another status conference. L.E.S. was not present. The district court denied the motion to continue and indicated its intent to "[o]rder the state of Utah to transport [L.E.S.] . . . for a termination of parental rights hearing on September 26, 2014."
 [*P16]  The termination of parental rights hearing was held on September 26, 2014, and the [***8]  district court made findings against L.E.S. and found that it was in the best interest of the child for K.A.S. to be adopted by C.D.M. L.E.S. filed a notice of appeal on October 22, 2014. The district court issued its "findings of fact[,] conclusions of law and order" on November 24, 2014, terminating L.E.S.'s parental rights in and to K.A.S.
 [*P17]  L.E.S. appealed the district court's termination order to the Utah Court of Appeals, which certified the case for transfer to the Utah Supreme Court on July 7, 2015. We heard oral arguments in the matter on September 2, 2015. On September 21, 2015, we asked for supplemental briefing from the parties and the Attorney General's Office on the constitutional question raised by L.E.S.'s argument that Utah Code section 78A-6-1111(1)(a) (2012) and section 78A-6-1111(1)(a)-(c) (2014) (two versions of the right-to-counsel provision of the Juvenile Court Act) violate equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and due process. Following supplemental briefing, oral arguments were again heard on March 2, 2016.
 [*P18]  L.E.S. raises four issues on appeal: a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and claims to the right to counsel under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and under the due process clause of the Utah Constitution. We hold that, even though not preserved, the [***9]  constitutional issues may be reached in this case under the exceptional circumstances exception. For reasons explained below, we hold that the denial of counsel violated L.E.S.'s federal due process rights. We reverse and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
 PRESERVATION
 [*P19]  We first address the issue of preservation and hold that the constitutional arguments for the right to counsel may be reached in this case under the exceptional circumstances exception. When an issue is not properly preserved, we will address the issue for the first time on appeal "only if (1) the appellant establishes that the district court committed 'plain error,' (2) 'exceptional circumstances' exist, or (3) in some situations, if the appellant raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to preserve the issue." State v. Low, 2008 UT 58, ¶19, 192 P.3d 867 (citation omitted); see also State v. Munguia, 2011 UT 5, ¶¶10-13, 253 P.3d 1082; H.U.F. v. W.P.W., 2009 UT 10, ¶25 n.12, 203 P.3d 943; State v. Lee, 2006 UT 5, ¶24, 128 P.3d 1179. Exceptional circumstances is a doctrine that "applies to rare procedural anomalies." Jacob v. Bezzant, 2009 UT 37, ¶34, 212 P.3d 535. We apply this "exception sparingly, reserving it for the most unusual circumstances where our failure to consider an issue that was not properly preserved for appeal would have resulted in manifest injustice." Id. (internal quotation marks [***10]  omitted).
 [*P20]  Exceptional circumstances is a narrow exception but one that is met by the unusual procedural circumstances in this case. The district court initially granted L.E.S. "appointed counsel in a parental-rights termination proceeding initiated by a private party in district court." The deputy county attorney, on whose advice the court had relied in appointing counsel, later filed a motion to intervene, arguing that the statute did not provide a right to counsel for termination proceedings in district court. L.E.S.'s court-appointed counsel failed to respond to the motion. Additionally, since L.E.S. was represented by counsel, L.E.S. had no right to oppose the motion himself. See State v. Navarro, 2010 UT App 302, ¶3, 243 P.3d 519 (per curiam) ("[T]he [criminal] defendant may not benefit from the assistance of counsel  [**284]  while simultaneously filing pro se motions."); State v. Wareham, 2006 UT App 327, ¶33, 143 P.3d 302 ("The [criminal] defendant may choose self-representation or the assistance of counsel, but is not entitled to a 'hybrid representation' where he could both enjoy the assistance of counsel and file pro se motions. The only exception to this rule is that a defendant may file a pro se motion to disqualify his appointed counsel." (citation omitted)). The court granted the unopposed [***11]  motion, denying L.E.S. court-appointed counsel. L.E.S. subsequently found himself unrepresented and would have to make a sophisticated constitutional argument for the right to counsel. Most importantly, L.E.S. had no technical vehicle for making such an argument because he had already lost on the issue of the right to counsel, and "[m]otions to reconsider are not recognized by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure." Tschaggeny v. Milbank Ins. Co., 2007 UT 37, ¶15, 163 P.3d 615.
 [*P21]  We conclude that these circumstances constitute one of those "rare procedural anomalies" that qualify for the exceptional circumstances exception to the preservation rule.2  When a party is appointed counsel who refuses to make an argument for the right to counsel when that right is challenged, and the party is barred from making that argument, and the party then is denied counsel and subsequently would have to make a sophisticated constitutional argument for the right to counsel with no technical vehicle for making such an argument, exceptional circumstances are met.3  Thus, under the exceptional circumstances exception, we may reach L.E.S.'s constitutional arguments for the right to counsel in parental-rights termination proceedings, even though they were raised for the first time on [***12]  appeal.
 ANALYSIS
 [*P22]  We apply the test from Lassiter v. Department of Social Services and determine that L.E.S. had a federal due process right to counsel in the district court proceedings and that that right was erroneously denied. 452 U.S. 18, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981).4  L.E.S. correctly argues that "the trial  [**285]  court erred by failing to consider the Eldridge factors" as applied by the United States Supreme Court in Lassiter.5  In Lassiter, the Court considered whether indigent parents in parental-rights termination proceedings have a right to counsel. The Court recognized that there is a presumption against the right to counsel unless an indigent litigant's physical liberty is at stake but held that that presumption may be overcome by the Eldridge factors. It determined that courts "must balance [the Eldridge factors] against each other, and then set their net weight in the scales against the presumption that there is a right to appointed counsel only where the indigent, if he is unsuccessful, may lose his personal freedom." Id. at 27.
 [*P23]  It appears from the record that the district court found that L.E.S. was indigent. Upon making that finding, the district court was required as a matter of law to apply the test set forth [***13]  in Lassiter in order to determine whether L.E.S. had a right to counsel. Nowhere in the record does it appear that the district court applied the Lassiter test. Instead, the district court appears to have based its decision that L.E.S. had no right to counsel on an interpretation of the right-to-counsel provision in the Juvenile Court Act and the lack of a corresponding provision in the district court context. This was error. And "because child-custody litigation must be concluded as rapidly as is consistent with fairness," rather than remand for additional findings, "we decide today whether the [district court] judge denied [L.E.S.] due process of law" under the Fourteenth Amendment by reversing its original appointment of counsel for L.E.S. Id. at 32. (footnote omitted).
 [*P24]  According to Lassiter,
[i]f, in a given case, the parent's interests were at their strongest, the State's interests were at their weakest, and the risks of error were at their peak, it could not be said that the Eldridge factors did not overcome the presumption against the right to appointed counsel, and that due process did not therefore require the appointment of counsel.
Id. at 31. To put it more plainly, where the parent's interests are at their strongest, [***14]  the State's interests at their weakest, and the risks of error at their peak,6  the presumption against the appointment of counsel has been overcome and due process requires the appointment of counsel. We now proceed to analyze the Eldridge factors in the context of the case at hand and determine that they overcome the presumption against the right to counsel. Thus, we conclude that L.E.S. had a federal due process right to counsel in the district court proceedings. Because that right was denied, we reverse and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.
I. L.E.S.'S INTERESTS
 [*P25]  First, we consider the private interests at stake: L.E.S.'s parental interest in his daughter, K.A.S. A parent's "right to 'the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children' is an important interest that 'undeniably warrants deference  [**286]  and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.'" Lassiter v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981) (quoting Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972)). In fact, "[t]he right of a fit, competent parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental public policy of [***15]  this state." Utah Code § 62A-4a-201(1)(c);7  see id. § 78A-6-503(1) ("Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the parent's child."); id. § 78A-6-503(4) ("The court should give serious consideration to the fundamental right of a parent to rear the parent's child, and concomitantly, [to] the right of the child to be reared by the child's natural parent."); see also Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 38 ("[F]ar more precious . . . than property rights, . . . parental rights have been deemed to be among those essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men." (first and second alterations in original) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, as noted in Lassiter, a "parent's interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status is . . . a commanding one." Id. at 27; see Utah Code § 62A-4a-201(1)(b) ("Until the state proves parental unfitness, . . . the child and the child's parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship."). Furthermore, the Court indicated that the parent's "extremely important" interest "may be supplemented by the dangers of criminal liability inherent in [***16]  some termination proceedings." Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 31.
 [*P26]  In this case, the parent's interests were at their strongest or very nearly so. L.E.S.'s right, as a parent, to the companionship, care, custody, and management of K.A.S. is clearly an important interest. Thus, he has a commanding interest in the accuracy and justice of the parental-rights termination proceeding. Furthermore, there is some concern regarding the risk of self-incrimination in this case, where the district court found that L.E.S. should have taken K.A.S.'s mother to court for refusing to facilitate visits but that he did not do so because "he was afraid because he was on drugs," and where the district court also noted that L.E.S.'s "extensive substance abuse is terms of neglect." It is unclear whether these findings were based on testimony elicited from L.E.S. or from evidence that was submitted, but L.E.S. did testify and was cross-examined, and it certainly appears that there was a risk of self-incrimination through the disclosure of information regarding his use of controlled substances.8  Thus, we conclude that L.E.S.'s interests were at their strongest or very nearly so.
II. THE STATE'S INTEREST
 [*P27]  Second, we consider whether the [***17]  State's interests in not appointing counsel were at their weakest. As the Court pointed out in Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, the State has divergent interests—it has an interest in appointing counsel as well as in not appointing counsel. The State has a legitimate pecuniary interest in not appointing counsel. 452 U.S. 18, 28, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981). However, the State's pecuniary interest "is hardly significant enough to overcome private interests as important as those here." Id. The Court in Lassiter also recognized that "the State may share the indigent parent's interest in the  [**287]  availability of appointed counsel" because of the State's "urgent interest in the welfare of the child" and its "interest in an accurate and just decision." Id. at 27. In Lassiter, the State was clearly invested in and therefore particularly interested in the child's welfare, as the parental-rights termination proceeding in that case was initiated by the Department of Social Services after the child had been in foster care for more than two years. Id. at 20-21, 28.
 [*P28]  The State's interest in not appointing counsel in the case at hand was relatively weak. The State, of course, had a legitimate pecuniary interest in not appointing counsel, but as in Lassiter, we [***18]  recognize that that interest is hardly significant enough to overcome an interest as important as a parent's rights to his or her child. And the State's interest in terminating L.E.S.'s parental rights was certainly less urgent in this case than it was in Lassiter, because this parental-rights termination proceeding was initiated and advanced by a private party rather than by the State. Regardless, the State still had an interest in the welfare of the child, and the State is necessarily involved in the termination of parental rights since only the State can terminate a parent's rights to his or her child. Thus, the State still "share[d] with the parent an interest in a correct decision," which is more "likely to be obtained through the equal contest of opposed interests." Id. at 28, 31. In this case, the State's interest in appointing counsel was stronger than its interest in not appointing counsel. Therefore, we conclude that the State's interest in not appointing counsel was relatively weak.
III. RISKS OF ERROR
 [*P29]  Third, we consider whether the risks of error were at their peak. Specifically, we consider "the risk that a parent will be erroneously deprived of his or her child because the parent is not represented [***19]  by counsel." Lassiter v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 452 U.S. 18, 28, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981). Similarly to North Carolina law as set out in Lassiter, Utah law provides a number of procedures to help ensure accurate decisions in parental-rights termination proceedings.9  By way of example, the petition must include "the grounds on which termination of parental rights is sought." Utah Code § 78A-6-505(1)(f). Additionally, a hearing must be held on the question of termination of parental rights, and the petitioner must "establish the facts by clear and convincing evidence." Id. § 78A-6-506(2)-(3).
 [*P30]  Despite such protections, there can still be considerable risk of error in parental-rights termination proceedings, which can be complicated for the parent seeking to defend his or her parental rights without the aid of counsel. The Court in Lassiter recognized the argument that parents are "uniquely well informed" about the subject of the parental-rights termination hearing (the parent's relationship with the child) but indicated that the ultimate issues in such cases are not always simple. Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 29-30. The Court pointed out that most parents would have difficulty understanding and confuting expert medical and psychiatric testimony, which is sometimes presented. Id. at 30. Additionally, it recognized that many parents facing termination [***20]  proceedings may "be people with little education, who have had uncommon difficulty in dealing with life, and who are, at the hearing, thrust into a distressing and disorienting situation." Id. Consequently, "courts have generally held that the State must appoint counsel for indigent parents at termination proceedings." Id.
 [*P31]  In the case at hand, the risks of error were significant. Because this case involves privately initiated termination proceedings, L.E.S. has not enjoyed the additional protections provided in state-initiated termination cases. See, e.g., Utah Code § 62A-4a-203(1)(a) ("[T]he division shall . . . make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the  [**288]  need for removal of a child from the child's home . . . ."); id. § 62A-4a-202(1)(a) ("[T]he division shall provide in-home services for the purpose of family preservation to any family with a child whose health and safety is not immediately endangered, when . . . the family is in crisis . . . ."); id. § 62A-4a-201(4) (indicating that after a temporary out-of-home placement, "the division may . . . (a) when safe and appropriate, return the child to the child's parent; or (b) as a last resort, pursue another permanency plan"); id. § 78A-6-503(3) ("If the party moving to terminate parental rights is a governmental [***21]  entity, the court shall find that any actions or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's child are supported by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty interests."); see also infra ¶ 35 n.10. Also, this case appears particularly disorienting because the court initially appointed counsel for L.E.S. upon a finding of indigence and later reversed the appointment of counsel based on an unopposed motion asserting that Utah law did not provide a right to counsel for termination proceedings in the district court. This left L.E.S. with the need to subsequently make a sophisticated constitutional argument for the right to counsel that he was unable to make without the assistance of counsel.
 [*P32]  Furthermore, L.E.S. was incarcerated throughout the duration of the proceedings, and it is clear from the record that this led to significant communication difficulties and at times even his inability to attend proceedings, either in person or telephonically. The district court recognized early on that L.E.S. "had difficulty [***22]  contacting family or counsel due to the prison telephone policies to make arrangement[s] to retain counsel." L.E.S.'s sisters attended several of the proceedings and attempted to help L.E.S. with his defense, but their efforts appear to have been hampered by communication issues with L.E.S. in prison. Supra ¶¶ 7-10. L.E.S. was unable to telephonically attend the status conference during which the final parental-rights termination hearing was scheduled "due to changes in probation officers at the prison" that resulted in him not being available by telephone. Supra ¶ 10. He also was not present at the September 8, 2014 status conference, where his motion to continue was denied. Supra ¶ 15.
 [*P33]  Additionally, although the district court held a number of status conferences in order to help L.E.S. obtain counsel, the district court mentions only one attorney that L.E.S. actually talked with, and L.E.S. reported to the district court that that attorney "was reluctant to take on the case in fear that because of the . . . prison policy she would not be able to provide adequate counsel."
 [*P34]  While no expert medical or psychiatric testimony or other similarly complicated evidence was brought before the court, it is [***23]  possible that had L.E.S. been represented by counsel, such testimony may have been brought. At this stage, it is difficult to conclude that the case below was simple and uncomplicated, dealing exclusively with issues about which L.E.S., as K.A.S.'s parent, was "uniquely well informed," when the apparent simplicity of the record may be due to the fact that L.E.S. represented himself pro se and had no opportunity to present more complicated evidence and argument with the aid of counsel. Thus, we conclude that the risks of error in this case were significant, even if not quite at their peak.
IV. ELDRIDGE FACTORS BALANCED AND WEIGHED AGAINST PRESUMPTION
 [*P35]  Finally, we balance the three Eldridge factors against each other and then weigh them against the presumption against the right to counsel. As already indicated, L.E.S.'s interest is "a commanding one," and the State shares L.E.S.'s interest in reaching a correct decision. When balancing these interests in favor of appointing counsel against the State's relatively weak, albeit legitimate, pecuniary interest in not appointing counsel, the equation clearly comes out in favor of appointing counsel. And when we add the significant risks of error [***24]  to this balance, it becomes abundantly clear that the Eldridge  [**289]  factors favor a right to counsel in this case. Upon weighing these significant interests against the presumption against the appointment of counsel, we hold that they outweigh that presumption and that L.E.S. therefore had a right to appointed counsel under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the initial appointment of counsel was reversed and L.E.S. had to proceed pro se, his federal due process right to counsel was violated.10 
 [*P36]  The dissent contends that our analysis "turns th[e] presumption [against the right to appointed counsel in civil cases] on its head" by "virtually guarantee[ing] appointment of counsel in most every case in which a parent's rights are in jeopardy." Infra ¶ 48. We disagree. We note, at the outset, that our task is simply to apply Lassiter to the case before us. That is, our task—our only task—is to consider whether the presumption against L.E.S.'s having a right to counsel is overcome because (1) L.E.S.'s interest in appointed counsel is strong, (2) the State's interest in denying appointed counsel is weak, and (3) the risks of error are high. Our [***25]  application of Lassiter in this case leads us to the conclusion that L.E.S. is entitled to counsel. While it would not surprise us if the presumption against the right to appointed counsel in civil cases were overcome with greater frequency in parental-rights termination proceedings than in other contexts where the stakes are lower and the core issue in the proceedings is less complicated than whether to sever the parent-child relationship, these potential empirical results do not drive our analysis. Our task is to faithfully apply Lassiter to the facts of each case before us; whatever pattern of outcomes emerges from this exercise is the pattern of outcomes required by the law. Cf. Lassiter v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 452 U.S. 18, 30, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 & n.6 (1981) (noting—without apparent concern—that the presumption against the right to counsel in civil cases has "generally" been overcome in the parental-rights termination context).
 [*P37]  The dissent understands the effect of Lassiter's presumption to be that the right to counsel in civil cases—including parental-rights termination cases—must be found only rarely. See infra ¶ 63 n.9. This is a misreading  [**290]  of Lassiter. To be sure, Lassiter acknowledges that there is a presumption against the right to counsel in civil cases. [***26]  But Lassiter nowhere implies that the effect of this presumption is that if courts regularly find a right to appointed counsel in parental-rights termination proceedings they are doing it wrong. To the contrary, Lassiter emphasizes that
the ultimate issues with which a termination hearing deals are not always simple, however commonplace they may be. Expert medical and psychiatric testimony, which few parents are equipped to understand and fewer still to confute, is sometimes presented. The parents are likely to be people with little education, who have had uncommon difficulty in dealing with life, and who are, at the hearing, thrust into a distressing and disorienting situation. That these factors may combine to overwhelm an uncounseled parent is evident . . . .
Lassiter 452 U.S. at 30. For this reason, Lassiter notes, "courts have generally held that the State must appoint counsel for indigent parents at termination proceedings." Id. Nor does Lassiter lament, or seek to change, this state of affairs. To be sure, at one point the Lassiter court conceded that it could not "say that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel in every parental termination proceeding." Id. at 31. And it is certainly true that [***27]  the Lassiter court concluded, under the specific facts before it, that counsel did not need to be appointed. But Lassiter's agnosticism about the frequency with which the Constitution would end up requiring the appointment of counsel in parental-rights termination proceedings is a far cry from a hard-nosed insistence that lower courts should work to make sure that the right to counsel in parental-rights termination cases is only grudgingly found.
 [*P38]  We also disagree with the dissent that our application of Lassiter "demands appointment in the run of the mill case." Infra ¶ 73 n.17. Instead, our application of Lassiter requires the appointment of counsel whenever the parent's interest in appointed counsel is strong, the state's interest is weak, and the risks of error are high. Our opinion is consistent with the proposition that in a case with circumstances like Lassiter—where, for example, the parent has not taken an interest in the proceedings and "the weight of the evidence" of the parent's lack of interest in the child is "great"—or in a case where the parent faced fewer procedural or institutional barriers to availing himself of the court, the presumption against the right to counsel [***28]  will not be overcome. Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 32; cf. supra ¶ 35 n.10 (noting evidence of L.E.S.'s interest in parenting K.A.S.). But, again, like the Supreme Court in Lassiter, our analysis is not driven by any empirical speculation about the frequency with which the presumption against the right to counsel will be overcome in parental-rights termination proceedings. We focus only on application of the legal test.11  And, for the reasons we have explained, our application of that test leads us to the conclusion that the presumption against the right to counsel is overcome in this case.
 CONCLUSION
 [*P39]  As discussed, we conclude that in the narrow circumstances of this case, the exceptional  [**291]  circumstances exception to the preservation requirement applies to allow us to reach L.E.S.'s constitutional arguments for the right to counsel. We also hold, based on the Lassiter test, that L.E.S. had a federal due process right to counsel in this case and that that right was improperly denied.12  Therefore, we reverse the decision of the court below.
 [*P40]  However, although L.E.S. had a federal due process right to counsel earlier, it is unclear from the facts of the case [***29]  whether he has such a right now. The right to counsel is available only to indigent individuals. During the proceedings below, L.E.S. requested a continuance until at least April 29, 2015, and in his briefing to the Utah Supreme Court, he indicated that he had hoped "to push the proceeding back to April when he would be out of prison and could pay for private counsel." Based on that information, L.E.S. is presumably no longer incarcerated, having presumably been released more than a year ago. Whether he is working and his current financial status are unknown to us. Thus, we do not know whether he is indigent. We therefore instruct the district court to first make a determination of whether L.E.S. is indigent. If the district court finds L.E.S. indigent, it should then proceed to apply the Lassiter test based on the facts and circumstances as they stand at that point, in order to determine whether L.E.S. should be appointed counsel based on federal due process for the parental-rights termination proceeding going forward.

Justice Durham, concurring:
 [*P41]  I concur in the analysis and the result of the majority opinion's treatment of the federal due process question. I write separately [***30]  to note that the court should have first analyzed the state due process claim raised by the appellant.
 [*P42]  "[A] state court always is responsible for the law of its state before deciding whether the state falls short of a national standard, so that no federal issue is properly reached when the state's law protects the claimed right." Hans A. Linde, E Pluribus—Constitutional Theory and State Courts, 18 Ga. L. Rev. 165, 178 (1984).
The right question is not whether a state's guarantee is the same as or broader than its federal counterpart as interpreted by the Supreme Court. The right question is what the state's guarantee means and how it applies to the case at hand. The answer may turn out the same as it would under federal law. The state's law may prove to be more protective than federal law. The state law also may be less protective. In that case the court must go on to decide the claim under federal law, assuming it has been raised.
Id. at 179. This court has, on numerous occasions, cited this methodology favorably.
 [*P43]  In West v. Thomson Newspapers, we observed that, as a matter of logic,
[t]he proper sequence is to analyze the state's . . . constitutional law[] before reaching a federal constitutional claim. This is required not for [***31]  the sake either of parochialism or style, but because the state does not deny any right claimed under the federal Constitution when the claim before the court in fact is fully met by state law.
By looking first to state constitutional principles, we also act in accordance with the original purpose of the federal system. Prior to the incorporation of the Bill of Rights,  [**292]  state constitutions were the only source of protection for individual rights and have continued as important sources of such rights ever since. Further, a growing number of courts have recognized both the utility and the legitimacy of fully exhausting state law before resorting to the federal constitution and accordingly have adopted the primacy model.
872 P.2d 999, 1006 (Utah 1994) (first alteration in original) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted) (quoting Sterling v. Cupp, 290 Ore. 611, 625 P.2d 123, 126 (Or. 1981)).
 [*P44]  In this case, appellant devoted nearly ten pages of a thirty-four page opening brief to the state Due Process Clause, and pointed out in his reply brief that appellees had failed to respond to his state constitutional arguments. Under those circumstances, I believe the court should have addressed them. Notwithstanding the ultimate result in this case under federal law, there will remain an open question as to the constitutionality [***32]  of Utah's appointment of counsel regime. See, e.g., In re Adoption of A.W.S., 2014 MT 322, 377 Mont. 234, 339 P.3d 414, 419-20 (Mont. 2014) (concluding that Montana's constitutional right to equal protection requires that counsel be appointed for indigent parents in termination proceedings brought under the state's Adoption Act).

Associate Chief Justice Lee, dissenting:
 [*P45]  Parental-rights termination cases are heart-wrenching. They present problems of enormous consequence—of severance of one of the most cherished of all human bonds, with the safety and welfare of children hanging in the balance. This is a matter on which our sensitivity for justice is heightened. And for that reason I can appreciate a desire to find a way to secure the appointment of counsel in a case like this one. As a pure policy matter, I see significant upsides in assuring that a parent has the benefit of legal counsel before his legal rights are terminated.
 [*P46]  That said, the issues before us are not policy questions. We are not legislators voting on a statute guaranteeing appointed counsel in parental-termination cases. We are judges faced with questions of law—under our law of preservation, and on matters of statutory and constitutional interpretation. And I find no basis in law for the majority's [***33]  conclusions.
 [*P47]  I respectfully dissent. First, I would hold that the father failed to preserve a claim for a right to counsel under the Due Process Clause and does not qualify under an exception to the rule of preservation. The "exceptional circumstances" exception invoked by the majority is not really a legal exception; it is more of a reservation of this court's "right" to reach the merits when we want to. We have never articulated concrete standards giving any distinct content to "exceptional circumstances." That is troubling. We, of course, have the final say and thus the ability to sidestep our own rules and precedents. But the fact that we are a court of last resort does not justify our exercise of power in a black box. We should exercise our discretion in a transparent and consistent manner. I see no way to do so under the "exceptional circumstances" doctrine. I would accordingly repudiate the exception here and going forward, and limit our review of unpreserved errors to those qualifying under the plain error doctrine or on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.
 [*P48]  Second, even assuming for the sake of argument that we can excuse the father's lack of preservation, I would reject his constitutional [***34]  claim on its merits. The standard set forth in Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981), prescribes a presumption against appointment of counsel in parental-rights termination cases. The majority turns that presumption on its head. It applies the Lassiter test in a way that virtually guarantees appointment of counsel in most every case in which a parent's rights are in jeopardy. That may be a good idea as a policy matter, but it is not required by the Due Process Clause—under either the United States Constitution or the Utah Constitution. I would so hold.
I
 [*P49]  I find no basis for excusing L.E.S.'s failure to preserve a constitutional claim to a right to counsel. He never asserted such a  [**293]  claim in the district court. He never invoked the Due Process Clause as a basis for appointment of counsel, and certainly never asked the district judge to apply the due process balancing test in Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981).
 [*P50]  The majority agrees. It concedes that L.E.S.'s constitutional claims were not preserved. Yet it still reaches the merits on the basis of so-called "exceptional circumstances." In so doing the court says that we reserve this exception for "unusual circumstances" in which "our failure to consider an issue that was not properly preserved for appeal would have resulted in manifest injustice." [***35]  Supra ¶ 19 (quoting Jacob v. Bezzant, 2009 UT 37, ¶ 34, 212 P.3d 535). And it cites "unusual procedural circumstances in this case" that purportedly qualify L.E.S. for the exception. Supra ¶ 20.
 [*P51]  I respectfully dissent. On reflection1  I have come to the conclusion that the "exceptional circumstances" doctrine should be repudiated. Our court has invoked this "exception" on a number of occasions over the years. Yet we have never really given it any distinct content. In fact we seem to have gone out of our way to do the opposite. We have spoken of the exceptional circumstances exception as "ill-defined," State v. Holgate, 2000 UT 74, ¶ 12, 10 P.3d 346, and our court of appeals has referred to it as a doctrine that is not "precise" and cannot "be analyzed in terms of fixed elements," State v. Irwin, 924 P.2d 5, 8 (Utah Ct. App. 1996).
 [*P52]  The majority follows a similar course in this case. Instead of defining the content of the doctrine, the court continues the practice of speaking in generalities. It concludes only that this is a "narrow exception" reserved for "unusual procedural circumstances," and proceeds to list the circumstances in this case that strike the court as noteworthy. Supra ¶ 20. That is doctrinally [***36]  circular. If we are unwilling or unable to define the content of the exceptional circumstances doctrine, then we don't really have a doctrine; we have a reservation of our "right" to ignore a preservation problem when we find it expedient.
 [*P53]  That strikes me as unacceptable. This is a court of law. We owe it to both the parties and the lower courts to operate in accordance with a transparent set of legal principles. Such principles assure the opportunity for evaluation of our decisions. They minimize the risk of arbitrary decision making. And they facilitate reliance on our caselaw.
 [*P54]  We undermine all of the above when we hide our analysis in the confines of a black box. That is the effect, in my view, of the "exceptional circumstances" doctrine applied today. Through the high-sounding rhetoric of "manifest injustice" and "rare procedural anomalies," supra ¶ 19, we create the appearance of a legal standard. But because we are unwilling to prescribe actual elements or standards for this doctrine, we are really just reserving an unchecked right to reach the merits when we want to.2 
 [*P55]  The majority identifies "circumstances" [***37]  that it deems "exceptional." It notes that the district judge "initially granted" L.E.S.'s request for appointed counsel before  [**294]  he switched course. Supra ¶ 20. And it concludes that that appointment left L.E.S. "unrepresented" and unable "to make a sophisticated constitutional argument for the right to counsel." Supra ¶ 20. With this in mind, the court purports to state a general holding: "When a party is appointed counsel who refuses to make an argument for the right to counsel when that right is challenged, and the party is barred from making that argument, and the party then is denied counsel and subsequently would have to make a sophisticated constitutional argument for the right to counsel with no technical vehicle for making such an argument, exceptional circumstances are met." Supra ¶ 21. But that is not the statement of a general rule. It is a summary of the facts of this case, followed by a conclusion that we prefer to reach the merits.3 
 [*P56]  The court's summary of the circumstances of the case, moreover, make this one seem rather unexceptional. First, I cannot see how the initial appointment of counsel can make any difference. The appointment, granted, made it initially more [***38]  difficult for L.E.S. to advance his constitutional claim as a pro se party--given that counsel failed to respond to the county attorney's motion asking the court to retract the earlier appointment. See supra ¶ 20 (asserting that "L.E.S. had no right to oppose the motion himself" while he was represented by counsel). But there is no reason to suspect that the initial appointment in any way inhibited L.E.S. from making a constitutional claim.4  From all  [**295]  that appears, neither L.E.S. nor his lawyer thought to make the argument. And in any event there is no doubt that L.E.S. had the chance to raise a constitutional claim in subsequent proceedings when he was no longer represented by counsel. Again he just failed to do so.
 [*P57]  That is why, presumably, the court falls back on the notion that the Lassiter framework involves a "sophisticated constitutional argument." Supra ¶ 20. Fair enough. But the argument under Lassiter is no more complex or "sophisticated" than any of a wide range of constitutional claims we have long deemed subject to the law of preservation. And presumably the court is not adopting a general exception to the law of preservation [***39]  for pro se parties advancing "sophisticated" constitutional claims.5  It is only asserting that "these circumstances" are sufficient. Supra ¶ 21. But that strikes me as inadequate. If we are unwilling to articulate a general rule, we leave the impression that we are acting lawlessly. And in the absence of any such rule here, I dissent from the invocation of the exceptional circumstances doctrine. Finding nothing in our caselaw to define the contours of any such rule, moreover, I would repudiate this doctrine going forward.
 [*P58]  I see no real barrier in our cases to so doing. We have adverted to an "exceptional circumstances" basis for an exception to the law of preservation in a string of past cases. But we have rarely invoked it in a case in which it made any difference. In most cases where we have articulated this exception, in other words, we have either declined to apply it6  or proceeded to identify an alternative basis for appellate review (either a determination that the matter was preserved or that review is necessary under the doctrine of plain error).7 
 [*P59]  [**296]   In these circumstances I see no stare decisis reason to retain the doctrine [***40]  of exceptional circumstances. That follows from the fact that the doctrine has rarely taken hold as a firm holding of the court, see State v. Gardiner, 814 P.2d 568, 572 (Utah 1991) (noting that "this court is not bound by earlier dicta"), and from the unpredictability and unworkability of the doctrine, see Eldridge v. Johndrow, 2015 UT 21, ¶ 40, 345 P.3d 553 (noting that "to determine whether a precedent has become firmly established," the court first asks "how well it has worked in practice"). Thus, I would observe the general rule of preservation in this case and limit exceptions to those more firmly rooted in our caselaw (plain error review and claims rooted in ineffective assistance of counsel).
 [*P60]  And I would affirm on that basis. L.E.S. cannot possibly establish plain error. The Lassiter balancing test, as noted below, is highly fact-intensive and case-specific. It can hardly be plain or obvious that counsel should have been appointed under the Lassiter standard, particularly where this court is divided on that same question. This is not an appropriate case for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, moreover. Under established caselaw, such a claim is limited to the criminal realm, in which a party has a Sixth Amendment right to counsel.8  This is not such a case, and L.E.S. has no basis [***41]  for avoiding the law of preservation by advancing a claim for ineffective assistance.
II
 [*P61]  Even accepting the majority's "exceptional circumstances" analysis for the sake of argument, I still would affirm. I would do so under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution under the standard set forth in Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981), which articulates a presumption against the mandatory appointment of counsel in a parental-rights termination case. I dissent from the majority's analysis because it seems to me to turn this presumption on its head. This is a simple, straightforward parental-rights termination case, and I would deem it subject to the presumption against the appointment of counsel set forth in Lassiter.
 [*P62]  That conclusion requires me to reach a question not addressed by the majority—whether L.E.S. has a right to appointed counsel under the Due Process Clause of the Utah Constitution, Utah Const. art. I, § 7. To decide that question I would begin with first principles—with the text of the Utah Constitution as understood at the time of its framing. And I would hold that L.E.S. has no right to appointed counsel as a matter of Utah constitutional law because such right would not have been recognized as a component of "due process" in 1896.
A
 [*P63]  The controlling due process framework under the [***42]  United States Constitution is that set forth in the Lassiter case. In Lassiter, the court reiterated a longstanding "presumption that there is a right to appointed counsel only where the indigent, if he is unsuccessful, may lose his personal freedom."9  452 U.S. at 27. Yet it  [**297]  also left room for an exception to this general rule. It held that the factors in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976)—"the private interests at  [**298]  stake, the government's interest, and the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions"—may weigh "against the presumption that there is a right to appointed counsel only where the indigent, if he is unsuccessful, may lose his personal freedom." Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 27.
 [*P64]  The Lassiter opinion assessed the relevant Eldridge factors as follows: "[T]he parent's interest is an extremely important one (and may be supplemented by the dangers of criminal liability inherent in some termination proceedings); the State shares with the parent an interest in a correct decision, has a relatively [***43]  weak pecuniary interest, and, in some but not all cases, has a possibly stronger interest in informal procedures; and the complexity of the proceeding and the incapacity of the uncounseled parent could be, but would not always be, great enough to make the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent's rights insupportably high." Id. at 31. Lassiter then set forth the following standard for rebuttal of the above-stated presumption:
If, in a given case, the parent's interests were at their strongest, the State's interests were at their weakest, and the risks of error were at their peak, it could not be said that the Eldridge factors did not overcome the presumption against the right to appointed counsel, and that due process did not therefore require the appointment of counsel. But since the Eldridge factors will not always be so distributed, and since "due process is not so rigid as to require that the significant interests in informality, flexibility and economy must always be sacrificed," neither can we say that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel in every parental termination proceeding. We therefore adopt the standard found appropriate in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, and leave [***44]  the decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel for indigent parents in termination proceedings to be answered in the first instance by the trial court, subject, of course, to appellate review.
Id. at 31-32 (citations omitted).
 [*P65]  The Lassiter court applied this standard in a case involving an incarcerated parent whose rights were severed on the basis of her failure to "maintain concern or responsibility for the welfare" of her child, and the determination that termination was in the "best interests of the minor." Id. at 24. In rejecting Ms. Lassiter's asserted right to appointment of counsel, the court focused on the nature of the issues in the case and the perceived need for counsel to address them. It noted that there were "no allegations of neglect or abuse upon which criminal charges could be based," id. at 32; it observed that "no expert witnesses testified and the case presented no specially troublesome points of law, either procedural or substantive," id.; and it concluded that "the weight of the evidence" was "sufficiently great that the presence of counsel for Ms. Lassiter could not have made a determinative difference" in the case, id. at 32-33.
 [*P66]  I view the Lassiter opinion as highlighting the importance [***45]  of the third Eldridge factor—the "risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions." Id. at 27. It does so in several ways. First is the court's reiteration of the presumption against the appointment of counsel (in a case in which incarceration is not a risk). The presumption is a core premise of the court's opinion. See id. at 26-27 ("[T]he presumption [is] that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty. It is against this presumption that all the other elements in the due process decision must be measured."); id. at 27 (the court "must balance [the Eldridge] elements against each other, and then set their net weight in the scales against the presumption that there is a right to appointed counsel only where the indigent, if he is unsuccessful, may lose his personal freedom"); id. at 31 ("[t]he dispositive question . . . is whether the three Eldridge factors, when weighed against the presumption that there is no right to appointed counsel in the absence of at least a potential deprivation of physical liberty, suffice to rebut that presumption . . . ."). And the presumption must be understood in light of the  [**299]  nature of the three factors from [***46]  Eldridge: For the most part, the private interests and the State's interests are static, so the factor that varies most from case to case is the third—the risk of error in a proceeding in which the parent proceeds without appointed counsel.
 [*P67]  The court's opinion underscores that point in the way it describes the three Eldridge factors. The discussion of the first two factors is relatively short and straightforward. And the court's description of these factors is mostly static. The court speaks in terms of the State's interests as they will stand in most all cases—in assuring the "welfare of the child," in securing "an accurate and just decision," and in seeing that the "termination decision [is] made as economically as possible." Id. at 27-28. The description of the "private" interests of the indigent parent is similarly static. Of that factor, the court highlights the "commanding" nature of the "parent's interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status," noting that this interest may be enhanced in a case involving a risk of criminal jeopardy. Id. at 27.
 [*P68]  The court's discussion of the third factor—the risk of error—is different. Here the analysis is decidedly dynamic [***47]  and clearly case-dependent. The court observes (citing the State's arguments) that the "subject of a termination hearing"—"the parent's relationship with her child"—may be "one as to which the parent must be uniquely well informed and to which the parent must have given prolonged thought." Id. at 29. It also states (again citing the State's arguments) that some termination proceedings are "not likely to produce difficult points of evidentiary law, or even of substantive law, since the evidentiary problems peculiar to criminal trials are not present and since the standards for termination are not complicated." Id. On the other hand, the court notes that "the ultimate issues with which a termination hearing deals are not always simple," offering the example of a case in which "[e]xpert medical and psychiatric testimony, which few parents are equipped to understand and fewer still to confute, is sometimes presented." Id. at 30.
 [*P69]  Finally, the court's application of these standards to the relevant facts in Lassiter underscores the crucial role of the third factor. In concluding that Ms. Lassiter was not entitled to appointed counsel, the Lassiter court cites circumstances rooted extensively in the risk of error analysis—the [***48]  lack of expert testimony or "troublesome points of law, either procedural or substantive," and the notion that the evidence was sufficiently strong that a lawyer would not likely have made a difference. See id. at 32-33.
 [*P70]  For these reasons it seems to me that the Lassiter standard is highly dependent on the third Eldridge factor.10  Fidelity to the Lassiter presumption, and to the above-stated standards, requires us to find a due process right to counsel only in the unusual parental-rights termination case—only in the case (unlike Lassiter or this case) in which there are complex legal or evidentiary questions requiring an unusual degree of legal expertise.11  The calculus may change where  [**300]  there is a risk of criminal jeopardy that supplements the parent's interest; but no such risk is present here.12 
 [*P71]  I would affirm because I find no such a basis for appointment of counsel here. From all that appears from the record, this is a garden-variety parental termination case in which the key issue concerns the "the parent's relationship with her child"13 —a matter on which the parent is "uniquely well informed [***49]  and to which the parent must have given prolonged thought." Id. at 29. L.E.S. has identified no "troublesome points of law," no difficult evidentiary issues, and no expert testimony that he was required to address. Nor has he identified any evidence he would have presented—or opposing evidence he would have rebutted more effectively—if he had been appointed a lawyer. And these failures are fatal.14  Absent any arguments along these lines, I see no basis for a rebuttal of the presumption in Lassiter.
 [*P72]  The majority opinion acknowledges the Lassiter presumption. Supra ¶ 22. And it cites no significant legal or evidentiary complexities of this case—no expert testimony at issue and no difficult question of legal analysis—that heightened the risk of error. Indeed the court concedes that there was "no expert medical or psychiatric testimony or other similarly complicated evidence [] brought before the court" and acknowledges "the apparent simplicity of the record." Supra ¶ 34. Yet the court nonetheless speculates that "it is possible" that such complications could be introduced into the case—that if L.E.S. had "been represented by counsel, such [expert] [***50]  testimony may have been brought" and the "simple and uncomplicated" case presented could well have been less so. Supra ¶ 34. Thus, the court says that "the apparent simplicity of the record may be due to the fact that L.E.S. represented himself pro se and had no opportunity to present more complicated evidence and argument with the aid of counsel." Supra ¶34. On that  [**301]  basis, the majority "conclude[s] that the risks of error in this case were significant," and sufficient to rebut the presumption against appointment of counsel. Supra ¶ 34.
 [*P73]  This analysis is unfaithful to Lassiter. By engaging a counterfactual hypothetical instead of analysis of the actual case presented, the court effectively inverts the Lassiter presumption. If the hypothetical possibility that a lawyer could transform a straightforward case into a complicated one is enough, then most any indigent parent will be entitled to counsel. That can most always be said.15  In future cases, a Utah parent seeking appointed counsel will not bear the burden set forth in Lassiter; he need only cite paragraph 33 of today's opinion—noting the hypothetical possibility that a lawyer could turn a "simple and uncomplicated" case into a complex one, and [***51]  concluding that that renders the risk of error "significant" enough to justify counsel's appointment.16  And if that is enough—as it apparently is under today's majority opinion—then we have flipped the Lassiter presumption.17 
 [*P74]  [**302]   Fidelity to Lassiter demands that we affirm the district court's decision not to appoint counsel for L.E.S. The majority's analysis of the significance of the parent's interest in maintaining a relationship with his child, supra ¶¶ 25-26, and the State's interests (a weak pecuniary interest in opposing appointment, and a shared interest in protecting the child and assuring a just outcome), supra ¶¶ 27-28, is insufficient. These points are broadly applicable premises that will hold in most any case. And such considerations cannot suffice to rebut the Lassiter presumption unless we are effectively inverting it.
 [*P75]  The court claims to find two unique features of this case in its analysis of the "private interest" and "government interest" factors. On the former the majority speculates that [***52]  there may be "some concern regarding the risk of self-incrimination in this case" given that "the district court found that L.E.S. should have taken K.A.S.'s mother to court for refusing to facilitate visits but that he did not do so because 'he was afraid because he was on drugs,'" and "the district court also noted that L.E.S.'s 'extensive substance abuse is terms of neglect." Supra ¶ 26. But this is a concern of the court's own imagining. L.E.S. failed to raise it in his briefs on this appeal, and the adoptive parents have therefore not been heard on the matter. And in any event a vague allusion to past drug use does not prove that there was a tangible risk of self-incrimination. I would not so conclude here—certainly not without adversary briefing on the matter.
 [*P76]  As to the second Eldridge factor, the court asserts that "the State's interest in terminating L.E.S.'s parental rights was . . . less urgent in this case than it was in Lassiter[] because this parental-rights termination proceeding was initiated and advanced by a private party rather than by the State." Supra ¶ 28. But I do not see how that follows. Any and all termination proceedings implicate the State's power and the [***53]  State's interest in protecting the safety and welfare of the child. See supra ¶ 28 (acknowledging that "the State is necessarily involved in the termination of parental rights since only the State can terminate a parent's rights to his or her child"). I see nothing in the record or in our law to support the court's premise that the State's interest is diminished in a case initiated by a private party. Certainly the interests of the child are the same regardless of who initiates the case. And the parent's interests are likewise unaltered. Where our law authorizes private parties to sue to initiate a parental-rights termination case, we should presume that such a case is advancing governmental policy.
 [*P77]  Finally, on the third factor, the court claims that the risk of error is more significant in a proceeding initiated by a private party because "L.E.S. has not enjoyed the additional protections provided in state-initiated termination cases." Supra ¶ 31. But this is the wrong baseline. Under Lassiter the question is not whether we can identify other cases in which the risk of error is diminished (due to "additional protections" afforded by statute or otherwise). It is whether the risk of [***54]  error is unreasonably "significant" as that inquiry is framed in the Lassiter opinion.
 [*P78]  The Lassiter court framed the inquiry by reference to North Carolina procedures available to the parent in that case. Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 28-29 (describing the procedures North Carolina established to "assure accurate decisions" in termination proceedings). And it found the risk of error insufficient to sustain the conclusion that counsel was necessary as a matter of due process. Id. at 32-33. That should be dispositive here. L.E.S. faced no greater risk than that faced by the parent in Lassiter. The Utah procedures afforded to L.E.S. are parallel to those available under North Carolina law in Lassiter. Compare Lassiter, 452 U.S at 28-29, with Utah Code §§ 78A-6-503 to -507. And, as stated above, L.E.S. has identified no "troublesome points of law," no difficult evidentiary issues, and no expert testimony that he was required to address.
 [*P79]  [**303]   For these reasons I view the Lassiter presumption as controlling here. I see no basis for a rebuttal of that presumption in this case. And I dissent from the majority's contrary conclusion, which seems to me to invert the presumption announced by the court.
B
 [*P80]  The controlling due process framework under the Utah Constitution has not been established in our [***55]  caselaw.18  To resolve L.E.S.'s state constitutional claim, I would accordingly begin with first principles—with the text of the Utah Due Process Clause, and with the meaning of those terms at the time of the framing of our Utah Constitution.19  I would examine the "plain meaning" of the text of the Utah Constitution in light of "historic experience" and the "presuppositions of those who employed them," keeping in mind "Utah's particular traditions at the time of drafting." American Bush v. City of S. Salt Lake, 2006 UT 40, ¶¶ 10, 12 140 P.3d 1235.
 [*P81]  L.E.S. purports to advance an originalist basis for his state due process claim. He cites late nineteenth-century history in support of the notion that our Utah founders valued parenthood and family unity highly, so much so that they embraced a religious belief that family bonds continue beyond this world. L.E.S. notes, in particular, the history of anti-polygamy raids in Utah, emphasizing the length to which our Utah founders went to protect their legal relationships with their children, and positing that they would have found parental-rights termination proceedings problematic. From that premise, L.E.S. posits that the framers of the Utah Constitution would have been in favor of appointment of counsel [***56]  in a parental-rights termination proceeding. And he urges us to read one into the Utah Due Process Clause on this basis.
 [*P82]  The cited history is interesting. And a party should always be commended for seeking to tie his constitutional analysis to the original meaning of the text.20  Here, however, L.E.S.'s history falls short because it is at far too high a level of generality. L.E.S. hasn't presented anything of relevance to the founding-era meaning of "due process." He has simply asserted that families were important to the generation that framed the Utah  [**304]  Constitution. That is undoubtedly true. But it tells us little or nothing about how far they were inclined to go in protecting families ties, and even less about whether they thought their inclinations were enshrined in the constitutional guarantee of "due process."
 [*P83]  To answer that question, we must look to the historical understanding of the principle of due process. And we must ask whether that principle encompasses a right to a lawyer appointed and paid for by the State. The answer to that question is no. I would reject L.E.S.'s state constitutional claim because it finds no [***57]  support in the 1890s-era understanding of "due process" and because it is undermined by the proceedings of the Utah constitutional convention.
1
 [*P84]  Historically, the guarantee of "due process of law" was understood as a legal term of art encompassing long-established principles associated with "the law of the land." $WEdward Coke, The Second Part of the Institutions of the Laws of England 46, 50 (3d ed. 1669). This is the understanding of "due process" that prevailed in the U.S. Supreme Court throughout the nineteenth century. A classic statement is set forth in Murray v. Hoboken Land & Imp. Co., 59 U.S. 272, 15 L. Ed. 372 (1855): "The words, 'due process of law,' were undoubtedly intended to convey the same meaning as the words, 'by the law of the land,' in Magna Charta." Id. at 276 (citation omitted).21 
 [*P85]  The "law of the land" was widely understood to encompass three basic guarantees: "(1) it rendered the King's power subject to 'law'; (2) it guaranteed the barons a right to participate in decisions which affected them; and (3) it assured equal treatment" under law.22  Thus, the guarantee of "due process" served as "a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the government." [***58]  Murray, 59 U.S. at 276. But the restraint on legislative power operated to prevent rather than require deviations from traditional notions of due process.
 [*P86]  In Murray, the United States Supreme Court laid out a historical test for determining whether a certain procedure satisfied "due process of law." Id. at 277. First, the court should "examine the constitution itself" and see if the procedure directly conflicts with any of its provisions. Id. If not, the court should then "look to those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England" as well as "the legislation of the colonies and provinces, and more especially of the States." Id. at 277-78. If a procedure was consistent with the practice of the common law and with "the laws of many of the [s]tates at the time of the adoption of this amendment" then it "cannot be denied to be due process of law." Id. at 280.
 [*P87]  In later cases, the United States Supreme Court elaborated upon this test. It explained that while a historical pedigree was sufficient condition for the "due process of law," the Constitution did not forbid innovative procedures that were not rooted in the common law tradition. The court noted that that would "deny every quality [***59]  of the law but its age, and . . . render it incapable of progress or improvement." Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 529, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884). Yet the court continued to reiterate that a practice rooted in historical tradition would survive due process scrutiny. It held that "any legal proceeding enforced by public authority . . . which regards and preserves these principles of liberty and justice, must be held to be due process of law." Id. at 537. And it noted that the Due Process Clause thus "refers to certain fundamental rights which [our] system of jurisprudence . . . has always recognized." Id. at 536 (citing Brown v. Bd. of Levee Comm'rs, 50 Miss. 468, 480 (1874) (emphasizing the requirements of jurisdiction, notice,  [**305]  and process as integral to due process of law)).
 [*P88]  The United States Supreme Court identified certain "principles of liberty and justice" that are integral to due process and are generally guaranteed as tenets of due process: "regular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial according to some settled course of judicial proceedings." Murray, 59 U.S. at 280; see also Wilkinson v. Leland, 27 U.S. 627, 657, 7 L. Ed. 542 (1829) (forbidding the exercise of eminent domain power "without trial, without notice, and without offence"). With the exception of certain summary procedures where these demands may not apply, such guarantees form the core protections of the Due Process Clause. See Murray, 59 U.S. at 280.
 [*P89]  State due process provisions [***60]  were interpreted in a similar fashion. In decisions throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, state supreme courts interpreted their state due process clauses to preserve a similar set of principles. The Tennessee Supreme Court, for example, interpreted that state's due process provision as a guarantee that all laws were "equally binding upon every member of the community," and not just available to certain favored groups. Sheppard v. Johnson, 21 Tenn. 285, 296 (1841); see also State v. Stimpson, 78 Vt. 124, 62 A. 14, 18 (Vt. 1905); Eden v. People, 161 Ill. 296, 43 N.E. 1108, 1109 (Ill. 1896). Other state supreme courts likewise embraced such a "law of the land" notion of due process.23  In other states, the courts extended the due process principle to protect against the infringement of certain fundamental tenets of due process, such as the right to a trial, Zylstra v. Corp. of Charleston, I S.C.L. (I Bay) 382 (1794), and a nonarbitrary procedure of adjudication under their state due process clauses, Vanzant v. Waddel, 10 Tenn. (2 Yer.) 260 (1829).
2
 [*P90]  Thus, the prevailing understanding of the Due Process Clause through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries can generally be summarized as follows: Procedures which were consistent with the common law and historical tradition were presumptively permissible, while new procedures were permissible so long as [***61]  they did not deny one of the core protections of due process, such as a right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.24 
 [*P91]  The historical understanding of "due process"—the view that prevailed at the time of the framing of the Utah Constitution—cannot be deemed to encompass a right to a lawyer paid for by the government. Nor can this principle be understood to yield to courts the power to prescribe evolving standards of constitutional "fairness" based on an assessment of the costs and benefits of innovations in procedure.
 [*P92]  We possess the power to assure fair procedure—and to do so by weighing costs and benefits. "But our usual course for so doing is by promulgating rules of procedure." In re Steffensen, 2016 UT 18, ¶ 7, 373 P.3d 186. Thus, the Due Process Clause does not impose upon us "a duty to establish ideal systems for the administration of justice, with every modern improvement and with provision against every possible hardship that may befall." Id. ¶ 7 n.2 (quoting Ownbey  [**306]  v. Morgan, 256 U.S. 94, 110-11, 41 S. Ct. 433, 65 L. Ed. 837 (1921)). "[T]he Due Process Clause is not a free-wheeling constitutional license for courts to assure fairness on a case-by-case basis." Id. ¶ 7. It is a historically driven test "measured by reference to 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice'" Id. [***62]  (citing ClearOne v. Revolabs, 2016 UT 16, ¶ 8, 369 P.3d 1269).
 [*P93]  I would interpret the Utah Due Process Clause in accordance with the historical understanding set forth above. And I would accordingly reject L.E.S.'s claim to a constitutional right to appointed counsel.
 [*P94]  L.E.S. has identified no historical basis for a due process right to a lawyer paid for by the state. The procedures afforded him accord with historical due process: He was given notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and the procedures available to him were in line with those secured historically. Because L.E.S. is seeking a novel advancement in procedure, his recourse is elsewhere—in a proposal for legislative reform, for example—and not in a state constitutional claim.
 [*P95]  I am aware of no historical evidence supporting the right to paid counsel. At the time of our Utah founding, a number of states had begun to provide for appointment of counsel in criminal cases.25  But none extended this right beyond the criminal context.26  And in the criminal realm, the right secured by the states was a legislative innovation, not a judicial one. And no one thought that such a right was inherent in the constitutional guarantee of due process.27 
 [*P96]  This held in Utah around the time of our founding. Our 1898 code provided for appointed counsel for indigent defendants in criminal cases, see Utah Revised Statutory Code of 1898, § 4767, but nowhere in our law was there a right to appointed counsel in a civil setting. And of course there was no indication in the early years of our state that anyone thought that "due process" guaranteed a lawyer paid for by the state (in a criminal case or otherwise).
 [*P97]  The debates in our Utah constitutional convention support this conclusion. A relevant part of the debate took place on March 23, 1898. On that date, the question arose as to whether the article 1 section 12 right not to be "compelled to advance money or fees to secure the rights herein guaranteed" also guaranteed a right to paid counsel. 1 Proceedings in the Constitutional Convention of 1898, at 308 (proceeding of March 23, 1898). Mr. Eldredge asked Mr. Evans (of Weber) what would happen to the "the poor fellow that has no money." Id. Evans responded that "[t]hat is usually provided by the legislature" and that "[i]t is a very unusual thing in constitutions, but a very usual thing in the statutory laws." Id. That is significant. And no one raised a parallel question [***64]  regarding the article 1 section 11 right in "any civil cause to which he is a party" to "prosecut[e] or defend[] before any tribunal in this State, by himself or counsel." See Utah Const. of 1896 art. I, § 11.
 [*P98]  For these reasons, I see no basis for finding a state constitutional right to appointed counsel in a case like this one. Due process is not a charter for "free-wheeling authority for the courts to second-guess the wisdom or fairness of legislative policy judgments." In re Adoption of B.Y., 2015 UT 67, ¶ 27, 356 P.3d 1215 (citation omitted). It is an assurance of a right to traditional, longstanding tenets of due process, such as a "reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard."  [**307]  Id. ¶ 16. I would reject L.E.S.'s claim because he cites no such basis for a right to appointed counsel.
III
 [*P99]  When a novel question of constitutional law presents itself, it is tempting to treat the question as an invitation to vindicate our gut-level sense of "justice," or in other words our sense of good policy. That temptation is heightened when the matter at hand is as sensitive and difficult as the one at issue here—of appointment of counsel in a parental-rights termination case. I can understand the impulse to find a basis for such an appointment. But I find no such basis [***65]  in constitutional law. And in the absence of such a basis, I would leave the matter to the legislature.
 [*P100]  That is the branch of government with the power and experience necessary to decide on the wisdom of allocating public money to support appointment of counsel. And it is the branch of government that has direct accountability to the people. Perhaps in time the legislature will decide that paid counsel should be appointed in a case like this one. Unless and until that happens, I would not find a legal right to appointed counsel in parental-termination cases.
