Opinion




The referee's recommendations as to guilt are approved. However, the referee's recommendation of a ten-day suspension is disapproved. Having considered the referee's report, the briefs and the response and reply to this Court's June 28, 2018, Order to Show Cause, the Court concludes that a 90-day suspension is warranted.
Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for 90 days, effective 30 days from the date of this order so that Respondent can close out his practice and protect the interests of existing clients. If Respondent notifies this Court in writing that he is no longer practicing and does not need the 30 days to protect existing clients, this Court will enter an order making the suspension effective immediately. Respondent shall fully comply with Rule Regulating the Florida Bar 3-5.1(h). In addition, respondent shall accept no new business from the date this order is filed until he is reinstated. Respondent is further directed to comply with all other terms and conditions of the report.
Judgment is entered for The Florida [*2]  Bar, 651 East Jefferson Street, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2300, for recovery of costs from John H. Faro in the amount of $1,590.00, for which sum let execution issue.
PARIENTE, QUINCE, POLSTON, LABARGA, and LAWSON, JJ., concur.
CANADY, C.J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion.
LEWIS, J., dissents.

Dissent




CANADY, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I concur in the approval of the recommendations as to guilt. But I dissent from the imposition of a non-rehabilitative sanction. I would instead impose a suspension of 91 days.
