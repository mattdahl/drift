Opinion




Upon review of the response to this Court's Order to Show Cause dated March 27, 2019, the Court has determined that it should exercise jurisdiction in this case. It is ordered that the Petition for Review is granted, that the Fifth District Court of Appeal's decision in this case is quashed, and this matter is remanded to the district court for reconsideration upon application of our decision in Williams v. State, 242 So. 3d 280 (Fla. 2018).
No Motion for Rehearing will be entertained by the Court.
LABARGA, LAGOA, LUCK, and MUÑIZ, JJ., concur.
CANADY, C.J., concurs with an opinion, in which POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.

Concur




CANADY, C.J., concurring.
I concur in the Court's uncontested disposition order. But I write to point out that the Court has never considered on the basis of full briefing by the parties the issue of remedy addressed in Williams v. State, 242 So. 3d 280 (Fla. 2018). In my view, that issue will be ripe for reconsideration when it is properly presented to the Court.
POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.
