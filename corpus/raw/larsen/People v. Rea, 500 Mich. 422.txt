 PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, Plaintiff-Appellant, v GINO ROBERT REA, Defendant-Appellee.  
Prior History: Gino R. Rea was charged in the Oakland Circuit Court with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI), MCL 257.625(1). A police officer parked his patrol vehicle in the street in front of defendant's driveway while responding to noise complaints from defendant's neighbor. As the officer walked up the straight driveway, defendant backed out of his detached garage and down the driveway. When the officer shined his flashlight to alert defendant that he was in the driveway, defendant stopped his car in the driveway, next to the house. Defendant then put his car in drive and pulled forward into the garage, bumping into stored items in the back of the garage. Defendant, who smelled of alcohol and whose speech was slurred, was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated after he refused to take field sobriety tests; defendant's blood alcohol level was later determined to be three times the legal limit set forth in MCL 257.625(1)(b). After his arraignment, defendant moved to quash the information. The court, Colleen A. O'Brien, J., granted the motion and dismissed the charge, finding that the upper portion of defendant's driveway, closest to the garage, was not a place generally accessible to motor vehicles [***1]  for purposes of criminal liability under MCL 257.625(1). On appeal, the Court of Appeals, GLEICHER, P.J., and SHAPIRO, J., (JANSEN, J., dissenting), affirmed the trial court's order, concluding that because the general public is not widely permitted to access the upper portion of a private driveway, defendant's operation of his vehicle while intoxicated did not fit within the purview of behavior prohibited under MCL 257.625(1). 315 Mich App 151; 889 N.W.2d 536 (2016). The Supreme Court ordered and heard oral argument on whether to grant the prosecution's application for leave to appeal or take other peremptory action. 500 Mich. 871, 885 N.W.2d 302 (2016) [***2] .

Opinion




 [**363]  [*425]   BEFORE THE ENTIRE BENCH
Bernstein, J.
This case concerns whether defendant, Gino R. Rea, may be charged under MCL 257.625 for operating a motor vehicle in his private driveway while intoxicated. We hold that, because defendant's conduct occurred in an area generally accessible to motor vehicles, the conduct was within the purview of MCL 257.625(1). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate [***3]  the trial court's dismissal of the case, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
In the early morning hours of March 31, 2014, police officers were dispatched three times to defendant's home because of a neighbor's noise complaints. On the third visit, Northville police officer Ken DeLano parked  [*426]  his patrol vehicle in the street in front of defendant's driveway, which is paved and straight. The driveway begins on the street, passes to the right of defendant's home, and extends to defendant's garage at the end of the driveway. The garage is detached from the home, and it is situated within defendant's backyard. There are no physical obstructions that block entry to defendant's driveway from the street.
As Officer DeLano walked up defendant's driveway to investigate the noise complaint, the overhead garage door opened, and defendant started to back his car down the driveway. After Officer DeLano shined his flashlight to alert defendant of his presence, defendant stopped his car, coming to a rest in the driveway, next to his house. When Officer DeLano approached defendant, who had remained in his car, the officer [***4]  noticed a strong odor of intoxicants. Officer DeLano also observed that defendant's eyes were glassy and blood shot and his speech was slurred. Defendant suddenly put the car in drive and pulled forward into the garage, bumping into stored items in the back of the garage. Defendant then got out of the car and started to walk toward Officer DeLano, swaying as he walked. Officer DeLano  [**364]  asked defendant to perform field sobriety tests, but defendant refused. Defendant was then arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. A blood test later conducted at a hospital revealed a blood alcohol level of .242 grams per 100 milliliters of blood—three times the legal limit. See MCL 257.625(1)(b).
The Oakland County Prosecuting Attorney charged defendant with one count of operating while intoxicated (OWI), MCL 257.625(1). Following a preliminary examination, defendant was bound over to the Oakland Circuit Court, where he moved to quash the information. On October 30, 2014, the trial court  [*427]  granted defendant's motion and dismissed the case, finding that the upper portion1  of defendant's driveway did not constitute an area that is "generally accessible to motor vehicles" for purposes of criminal liability under MCL 257.625(1). In a split, [***5]  published opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling, holding that the upper portion of the driveway did not constitute a place generally accessible to motor vehicles because "[t]he 'general public' is not 'widely'. . . permitted to 'access' that portion of a private driveway immediately next to a private residence." People v Rea, 315 Mich App 151, 157; 889 NW2d 536 (2016).
The prosecution sought leave to appeal in this Court. We scheduled oral argument on the application, directing the parties to address "whether the location where the defendant was operating a vehicle was a place within the purview of MCL 257.625." People v Rea, 500 Mich 871; 885 N.W.2d 302 (2016).
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Whether a defendant's conduct falls within the scope of a penal statute is a question of statutory interpretation that is reviewed de novo. People v Hill, 486 Mich 658, 665-666; 786 NW2d 601 (2010). "Statutes . . . are interpreted in accordance with legislative intent . . . ." People v Mazur, 497 Mich 302, 308; 872 NW2d 201 (2015). "[T]he most reliable evidence" of that intent is the plain language of the statute. Id. (citations and quotation marks omitted). When interpreting a statute,  [*428]  "we must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory." People v Miller, 498 Mich 13, 25; 869 NW2d 204 (2015) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Nontechnical words and phrases should [***6]  be interpreted "according to the common and approved usage of the language." People v Dunbar, 499 Mich 60, 67; 879 NW2d 229 (2016) (citation and quotation marks omitted). When a word or phrase is not defined by the statute in question, it is appropriate to consult dictionary definitions to determine the plain and ordinary meaning of the word or phrase. People v Feeley, 499 Mich 429, 437; 885 NW2d 223 (2016).
III. ANALYSIS
The Michigan Vehicle Code, MCL 257.1 et seq., prohibits a person from operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Specifically, MCL 257.625(1) provides in pertinent part:
A person, whether licensed or not, shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway or other place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor  [**365]  vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state if the person is operating while intoxicated.
Accordingly, MCL 257.625(1) prohibits operating a vehicle while intoxicated in three types of locations: (1) upon a highway, (2) in a place open to the general public, or (3) in a place generally accessible to motor vehicles. The issue before us is whether defendant's driveway was "generally accessible to motor vehicles."2 
 [*429]  The crux of this dispute is the meaning of the phrase "generally accessible" in MCL 257.625(1). Because the Michigan Vehicle Code does not define the phrase "generally [***7]  accessible," we consult the dictionary definitions of these words. Feeley, 499 Mich at 437. The word "generally" is an adverb that modifies the adjective "accessible." "Generally" is defined as "in a general manner"; "in disregard of specific instances and with regard to an overall picture"; and "as a rule: USUALLY." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed).3  The term "accessible" means "providing access"; "capable of being reached: being within reach" and "capable of being used or seen." Id.4   [**366]  Therefore, the plain  [*430]  and ordinary meaning of the phrase "generally accessible" means "usually capable of being reached."
This phrase must be considered in its statutory context: "other place . . . generally accessible to motor vehicles." MCL 257.625(1). The phrase "generally accessible" modifies the preceding noun phrase "other place." Accordingly, the prohibition in MCL 257.625(1) against operating a vehicle while intoxicated does not apply to every place.5  Instead, the statute's prohibition  [*431]  applies only to highways, to other places open to [***8]  the general public, and to other places that are generally accessible—that is, usually or ordinarily capable of being reached.6  Finally, we must incorporate the phrase "to motor vehicles," which is an adverbial prepositional phrase that modifies "generally accessible." The Michigan Vehicle Code defines "motor vehicle" as "every vehicle that is self-propelled . . . ." MCL 257.33. Therefore, as a whole, the relevant statutory provision prohibits an intoxicated person from operating a vehicle in a place that is usually capable of being reached by self-propelled vehicles.
The Court of Appeals majority erred when it concluded that whether a place is "generally accessible to motor vehicles" depends on whether the general public "widely" or "popularly" has permission to enter the  [*432]  location.7  Rea, 315 Mich App at 155-158. This conclusion is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute in several respects. First, the Court of Appeals majority erroneously construed the term "generally" to mean open to an unrestricted number of users.  [**367]  See id. at 157. But the use of the modifier "to motor vehicles" shows that the focus is not whether most people can access the area, but whether most motor vehicles can [***9]  access the area. The Court of Appeals majority similarly erred by construing "accessible" to mean permission to enter. Id. An object, unlike an operator of the object, is not typically given permission to enter a location. We therefore read "accessible" to instead refer to whether motor vehicles have the ability to enter an unsecured private driveway, not whether their operators have permission to do so. Consequently, the Court of Appeals majority's statement that only a small subset of vehicles are permitted to use the upper portion of the driveway even though the public may access the lower portion of the driveway is simply irrelevant. See id. This arbitrary line-drawing between the lower and upper portion of defendant's driveway has no basis in the language of MCL 257.625(1).
Furthermore, to construe the phrase "generally accessible" as dependent on whether the general public has permission to enter the location would conflate the two phrases "open to the general public" and "generally accessible to motor vehicles." In MCL 257.625, these two phrases are separated by the disjunctive term "or," which indicates separate alternatives. See People v Kowalski, 489 Mich 488, 499 n 11; 803 NW2d 200 (2011) ("'Or' is . . . a disjunctive [term], [***10]  used to indicate  [*433]  a disunion, a separation, an alternative.") (citation and quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). For that reason, to similarly interpret "generally accessible to motor vehicles" as concerning whether the general public has permission to enter would nullify the disjunctive term "or" and render the phrase "generally accessible to motor vehicles" needless surplusage. This Court must avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute nugatory. Miller, 498 Mich at 25.
This is especially true in light of the statutory history of MCL 257.625(1). Previously, MCL 257.625(1) only prohibited operating a vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor "upon a highway or other place open to the general public." MCL 257.625(1), as amended by 1982 PA 309, effective March 30, 1983. In 1991, the Legislature amended the statute to include an area not previously covered under the statute: a place that is "generally accessible to motor vehicles." See MCL 257.625(1), as amended by 1991 PA 98, effective January 1, 1992. This amendment broadened the scope of the OWI statute to include an additional, alternative place where operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated is prohibited.8  People v Nickerson, 227 Mich App 434, 440; 575 NW2d 804 (1998). Accordingly,  [*434]  the phrase "generally accessible to motor vehicles" must be meaningfully [***11]  distinguished from the phrase "open to the general public." "Open to the general public" concerns who may access the location, while "generally accessible to motor vehicles" concerns what can access the location. This interpretation avoids redundancy  [**368]  and provides meaning to both phrases.9 
We now apply our plain language interpretation of the statute to the facts at issue in this case. Defendant's private driveway is designed for vehicular travel.10  Areas designed for vehicular travel, are by their nature, areas a vehicle is usually capable of  [*435]  accessing. Additionally, there is nothing on defendant's driveway that would prevent motor vehicles on the public street from turning into it.11  Given these facts, defendant's driveway is a place motor vehicles are usually capable of entering. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant's driveway was generally accessible to motor vehicles under MCL 257.625(1).12 
Moreover, there is ample reason for the Legislature to prohibit operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated on an unobstructed driveway. Although the driveway is private property, should an intoxicated driver strike a child crossing his or her driveway, [***12]  the injury to the child is still as real as it would have been if the child had been playing in the street. And, as the dissent concedes, the Legislature has the authority to "regulate and even outlaw certain conduct on private property."
 [**369]  [*436]   For the aforementioned reasons, MCL 257.625 encompasses defendant's private driveway. The Court of Appeals majority did not properly apply the plain meaning of MCL 257.625(1) because the Court failed to distinguish between "open to the general public" and "generally accessible to motor vehicles." Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred by upholding the trial court's order to quash the information.
IV. CONCLUSION
We hold that defendant's driveway is an area "generally accessible to motor vehicles" for purposes of MCL 257.625(1). Because defendant allegedly operated a motor vehicle in his driveway while intoxicated, the prosecution established probable cause that defendant violated MCL 257.625. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate the trial court's dismissal of the case, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Larsen, J. (concurring in the result only [***13] ).
I agree with the majority that defendant may be charged under MCL 257.625 with operating a motor vehicle in his private driveway while intoxicated. I write separately because I believe that the case before us fits easily within the statute; I would, therefore, wait for a case that pushes the boundaries of MCL 257.625 to explore where its edges lie.
MCL 257.625(1) states: "A person, whether licensed or not, shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway or other place open to the general public or generally  [*437]  accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state if the person is operating while intoxicated." Driving drunk is, therefore, prohibited in three places: (1) "upon a highway," (2) in an "other place open to the general public," or (3) in "[another] place generally accessible to motor vehicles." We must decide whether driveways are "generally accessible to motor vehicles."
That to ask the question comes close to answering it is not, alone, sufficient to decide the case. But it is a clue that should not be discounted. Sometimes, when exploring the overall scheme of a statute, the initially intuitive reading proves wrong. But it is often the case that the most straightforward [***14]  meaning is actually the one initially conveyed. A speaker of ordinary English would not readily conclude that driveways are not "generally accessible to motor vehicles," and that should give us pause before we conclude that the Legislature chose those words to produce such a result. Further study of the statute does not dislodge the initial impression. The whole point of a driveway is to provide access to motor vehicles. Where the place is designed to be capable of being reached by motor vehicles, the answer to whether it is "generally accessible to motor vehicles" is simple: of course.
I. "ACCESSIBLE"
An accessible place, the majority, the dissent, and I all agree, is one that is, in some sense, "capable of being reached." The majority focuses on whether a place is physically capable of being reached. While I agree that access often denotes physical access, and might well do so in this context, I share in the dissent's concern that,  [**370]  unmodified, this definition might prove too much. A car may be physically capable of barreling down a barricade  [*438]  or crashing into someone's living room but no one would say that a living room is "generally accessible to motor vehicles," just as no one would [***15]  say that a location is wheelchair-accessible merely because, given sufficient momentum, a wheelchair can be made to surmount a curb. These examples help us see that "accessible" might be used in the majority's physical sense but with a narrower reach: some dictionaries define "accessible" as "easy to approach, reach, enter, speak with, or use." Random House Webster's College Dictionary (2001) (emphasis added). See also Webster's New World College Dictionary (5th ed) ("that can be approached or entered" or that is "easy to approach or enter"); The American Heritage Dictionary (2d college ed) ("Easily approached or entered."); Webster's II New College Dictionary (1995) ("Easily approached or entered."). On this definition, a ramp is wheelchair-accessible; a curb is not. So too with a driveway. Most are readily, or easily, physically accessible by motor vehicles; and even if some might not be—because they are graded too steeply or are in great disrepair—that would make no difference—the category (driveways) need only be "generally" so. The majority, however, focuses not on ease, but on capability. And while a driveway surely fits within the majority's definition, I share the dissent's [***16]  concern that the majority may have adopted a rule that has few boundaries.1 
 [*439]  The dissent, on the other hand, asks if the place is one "where vehicles are routinely permitted to enter." (Quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis added.) The dissent, like the Court of Appeals panel below, has thus introduced the idea of legal or customary as opposed to physical accessibility. But if a place is "generally accessible" when "vehicles are routinely permitted to enter" by virtue of rights of ownership or permission granted by the owner, then surely a private driveway is such a place. Vehicles driven by friends and relatives, service providers, and salesmen are all "routinely permitted to enter" one's driveway. Moreover, one's own vehicles are routinely, indeed daily, permitted to enter one's driveway. The statute, it should be remembered, states only that the area must be "generally accessible to motor vehicles"; it does not say that it must be "generally accessible to motor vehicles owned by others." And so even if "accessible" means "legally accessible," I see nothing in the statute to suggest that one's own trips up and down the driveway should not count. Driveways, in general, [***17]  are legally accessible by, at least, some motor vehicles.
II. "GENERALLY"
Whether "accessible" is defined as "physically capable of being reached,"  [**371]  "physically easy to reach," or "legally capable of being reached," I conclude that driveways are "accessible to motor vehicles." But what, then, of "generally?" The majority defines "generally"  [*440]  as "usually."2  The dissent, however, fears that the majority's rule threatens to "cover[] any land not under water" despite the Legislature's decision not to prohibit driving while intoxicated in all places "within this state." Cf. MCL 257.625m(1) (stating that an intoxicated person "shall not operate a commercial motor vehicle within this state"). To avoid such a broad interpretation, the dissent reads "generally" to mean "'to or by most people; widely; popularly; extensively.'"3  Quoting Webster's New World College Dictionary (5th ed). The dissent thus requires that the place where  [*441]  vehicles are "'routinely permitted to enter'" also be available "'to or by most [motor vehicles],'"4  "'widely,'" or to "an appreciable number of motor vehicles." (Citations omitted.) And because any particular private driveway is not legally accessible to most motor vehicles, the dissent [***18]  concludes that, as a category, private driveways are not generally accessible to motor vehicles.5 
 [**372]  [*442]   While the dissent's interpretation of "generally accessible to motor vehicles" might be one way to make the statute work, it certainly takes the long way home when there are much straighter routes to resolving this case. And while I share the dissent's concern that the majority may have adopted a rule that has few, if any, boundaries, the dissent's desire to avoid an overly broad interpretation has caused it to eliminate the obvious case. I cannot agree with the dissent that driveways are not "generally accessible to motor vehicles." If "generally" means "usually," or "in general," then driveways are "generally accessible to motor vehicles," whether "accessible" means "physically capable of being reached," "physically easy to reach," or "legally capable of being reached." Only if "generally" includes some idea of volume ("popularly") and "accessible" means "legally so," could driveways [***19]  possibly be out of bounds. But that reading comes at the cost of the most natural reading of the statutory text. One stumbles to say that "driveways are not generally accessible to motor vehicles" and that is sufficient to dispel for me whatever doubt the dissent's complex formulation might raise.
* * *
Because I believe that driveways are "generally accessible to motor vehicles," I would resolve this straightforward case on its own facts and leave for a future case the determination of the precise boundaries of MCL 257.625(1). I, therefore, concur in the judgment only.

Dissent




McCormack, J. (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent. I believe we must read the language "generally accessible to motor vehicles" in MCL 257.625(1) as meaning  [*443]  something more specific than just whether a place is "usually capable of being [physically] reached" by motor vehicles, as the majority does, an interpretation that threatens to swallow the rest of the statute. We should give this language a meaning that respects each clause in the statute.
MCL 257.625(1) sets forth three categories of places in which a person can be penalized for operating a vehicle while intoxicated: (1) upon a "highway," (2) in an "other place open to the [***20]  general public," or (3) in an other place "generally accessible to motor vehicles." The first two categories are easy to understand; both indisputably cover places that are open to the general public.1  And I agree with the majority that the Legislature's decision to add the third category in 1991 must have been intended to expand the scope of the statute to cover  [**373]  some areas not covered by the first two clauses, i.e., some areas that are not open to the general public. The question, then, is what places not open to the general public are covered by the third clause: "generally accessible to motor vehicles."
One weakness in the majority's interpretation—whether a place is "usually capable of being [physically] reached" by a motor vehicle—is that it threatens to swallow the "open to the general public" language in the statute. This is so because every place open to the general public will also always be "generally accessible to motor vehicles."2  Put differently, the majority's interpretation  [*444]  is unpersuasive because under the majority's reading, the phrase "generally accessible to motor vehicles" does all the work and makes the surrounding statutory language pointless. Moreover, if the "generally [***21]  accessible" category encompasses any place that is "usually" physically accessible to motor vehicles, what places are excluded that would otherwise be included if the statute read merely "accessible to motor vehicles"? Modern engineering allows motor vehicles to access many places; what does it add to the inquiry that the vehicle be not just capable of physically accessing the area, but "usually" capable of physically accessing the area? I see no answer to that question in the majority's analysis.
There is more. The majority's broad interpretation of "generally accessible" also ignores other statutes that prohibit driving specific types of motor vehicles while intoxicated. When the Legislature has wanted to prohibit drunken driving in all places, it has done so in clear terms. See, e.g., MCL 257.625m(1) (providing that an intoxicated person "shall not operate a commercial motor vehicle within this state"); MCL 324.81134(5) (providing that a person who operates an off-road vehicle "within this state" while intoxicated and causes a serious impairment of a body function of another person is subject to various penalties); MCL 324.82127 (prohibiting the operation of a snowmobile while intoxicated "in this state"). The Legislature's [***22]   [*445]  decision not to use the broadest phrase possible in MCL 257.625(1) obligates us to give a meaning to the phrase "generally accessible to motor vehicles" that does not amount to a complete prohibition on operating while intoxicated anywhere "in this state." Yet the majority's "usually capable of being reached" by motor vehicles standard leaves few to no places uncovered, particularly given the expansive definition of what constitutes a "motor vehicle." See, e.g., MCL 257.33 (defining "motor vehicle" as "every vehicle that is self-propelled," with a few limited exceptions).
Thus, the majority's interpretation gives the statute immense reach—arguably covering any land not under water. Confusingly then, in its application, the majority has apparently decided to impose some limitations on its own standard. The majority states that "defendant's driveway is a place motor vehicles are usually capable of entering" because it is "designed for vehicular travel" and "there is nothing on  [**374]  defendant's driveway that would prevent motor vehicles on the public street from turning into it." (First emphasis added.) But the majority never explains from where these limitations originate or how they should be interpreted and applied [***23]  in future cases.
If the Legislature had wanted to limit the statute's reach to places "designed for vehicular travel" it could have done so, just like it did in MCL 691.1402(1), which provides that a governmental agency's duty to "repair and maintain highways . . . extends only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel . . . ." Similar language does not appear in MCL 257.625(1). We have had some difficulty interpreting this standard in the context of highway repairs. See, e.g., Yono v DOT, 499 Mich. 636; 885 N.W.2d 445  [*446]  (2016). How it will be interpreted and applied outside of that context is anyone's guess.
The second limitation, in my view, is equally problematic. What, precisely, suffices as a preventative check on a vehicle's entry into a given place? Would a security gate with an articulating arm qualify? That would seem to exclude all sorts of places where people congregate in their cars. Does it matter if the arm of the security gate is up or down? Or if the driver has the ability to activate the arm? Or what about a gated community, that is, a subdivision with a large metal gate that restricts access? I am perplexed that the majority's interpretation will sweep in private driveways but exclude these other places that the Legislature [***24]  likely intended to cover.
In my view, there is a more sensible way to interpret the scope of the statute's third clause. This interpretation "examine[s] the statute as a whole, reading individual words and phrases in the context of the entire legislative scheme." Madugula v Taub, 496 Mich 685, 696; 853 NW2d 75 (2014). To properly interpret the "generally accessible" clause, therefore, we must examine each of the three related clauses in MCL 257.625(1) in turn.
The first and second clauses are separated by the disjunctive "or," and the second clause is prefaced by the word "other"—"other places open to the general public." Both clauses, therefore, encompass places open to the general public. The first, "highway," is defined in the Motor Vehicle Code—so we don't have to guess about its precise meaning. See MCL 257.20. The second clause, "open to the general public," is undefined, so we look to the usual sources to determine its ordinary meaning. That meaning was well-explained in People v Hawkins, 181 Mich App 393; 448 NW2d 858  [*447]  (1989), a case that predated the 1991 amendment of MCL 257.625(1). In Hawkins, the Court of Appeals held that the statutory phrase "other place[s] open to the general public" focuses on public accessibility and interpreted it to include areas that invite and do not have any barriers to public access. The Court explained:
"For [***25]  an area to be 'open to public use' it does not have to be open to 'everybody all the time.' The essential feature of a public use is that it is not confined to privileged individuals or groups whose fitness or eligibility is gauged by some predetermined criteria, but is open to the indefinite public. It is the indefiniteness or unrestricted quality of potential users that gives a use its public character." [Hawkins, 181 Mich App at 398-399, quoting State v Boucher, 207 Conn 612, 615; 541 A2d 865 (1988).]
The panel concluded that a shopping center parking lot that was "accessible to the general public without restriction" was a "place open to the general public" for purposes  [**375]  of MCL 257.625(1). Hawkins, 181 Mich App at 399.3  I believe the panel was correct that a place "open to the general public" is a place that is "accessible to the general public without restriction." Id. at 399 (emphasis added).
What does this mean for the third clause? It means, logically, that the third clause furthers the statute's reach by including places to which access is restricted in some way.4  But we also know that the third clause  [*448]  was not intended to encompass every place "in this state." So what places, beyond those that are "open to the general public," were added by the 1991 amendment? I believe, for the reasons below, that the "generally [***26]  accessible to motor vehicles" clause was intended to cover places that are open to an appreciable number of motor vehicles, even if their access is restricted by physical or other barriers to entry.
In determining what places are "generally accessible to motor vehicles," the touchstone is accessibility. "Accessible" means some places not open to the general public (because, as noted, places open to the general public are plainly already covered by the first two clauses) "that can be approached or entered" or that are "easy to approach or enter." Webster's New World College Dictionary (5th ed). A place where access is restricted, but still possible, is "accessible" because it is "capable of being reached." But while "accessible" reaches places with restrictions, "generally" must  [*449]  meaningfully modify "accessible". "Generally" means "to or by most people; widely; popularly; extensively[.]" Webster's New World College Dictionary (5th ed).5  This definition of "generally" finds textual support in MCL 257.625(1), which requires the area to be "generally accessible by motor vehicles"—that is, by multiple vehicles, suggesting a certain volume of use is required.6  A place  [**376]  is "generally [***27]  accessible," then, if it is a place "where vehicles are routinely permitted to enter." People v Nickerson, 227 Mich App 434, 440; 575 NW2d 804 (1998).
In other words, some places are, though not open to the general public without restriction, accessed regularly by an appreciable number of vehicles. Private roads—in private neighborhood associations, motor home parks, private cul-de-sacs, limited rights of way, commercial driveways with limited hours, and so on—would be the paradigm. But an individual homeowner's residential driveway is not one of those places, according to our Legislature. Indeed, the Legislature has defined a "private driveway" as "any piece of privately owned and maintained property which is used for vehicular traffic, but is not open or normally  [*450]  used by the public." See MCL 257.44(1) (emphasis added).7  Thus, if a particular driveway is "normally used by the public" it is not a private driveway. Further, if a driveway is not "normally used by the public," it is not accessed by an appreciable number of vehicles, and therefore cannot sensibly be considered "generally accessible."8 
As I say, many private roads are "generally accessible to motor vehicles." That is, they are "widely" accessible to a significant number of motor [***28]  vehicles despite not being open to the general public. Indeed, there are countless private roads that run through subdivisions, private developments, apartment and condominium complexes, and motor home communities in Michigan. And in fact, the Legislature has defined a "private road" as "a privately owned or maintained road, allowing access to more than 1 residence or place of business, which is [nevertheless] normally open to the public and upon which persons other than the owners located thereon may also travel." MCL 257.44(2) (emphasis added). Although such roads are privately owned and maintained (and therefore not a "highway" or another place "open to the general public" for purposes of MCL 257.625(1)), they are "normally open to the public" to drive upon. Therefore,  [*451]  they are "widely accessible" to motor vehicles. Private parking structures would be similarly included, as would private roads to and within private country clubs, for another example. It makes sense that the Legislature would want to outlaw intoxicated driving for all of these.
But an individual homeowner's residential driveway is another matter altogether. We should be most hesitant to assume—and should expect far more clarity from our Legislature [***29]  before we conclude—that the state seeks to extend its reach onto the  [**377]  private property of individual homeowners. Private property rights are, of course, central to our legal system—every person has "exclusive dominion over his own soil."9  If a private citizen chooses to have a few beers while washing his car (or to wash his car while having a few beers), on a patch of his own land covered by a driveway, that is his right.
Dominion, yes—absolute immunity from regulation, of course not: There is no doubt the state can regulate and even outlaw certain conduct on private property. My point is that we should not lightly assume that our Legislature intends to do so.10  This is particularly so here because this statute has historically focused on  [*452]  areas open to the general public without restriction.11  While the Legislature would understandably seek to prohibit intoxicated driving on the countless private roads in this state, it does not follow that our Legislature would want to extend that prohibition to an individual homeowner's private driveway or patch of tire-tracked grass.12 
For these reasons, the defendant was entitled as a matter of law to dismissal of the charge of operating a motor vehicle [***30]  while intoxicated. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals.
