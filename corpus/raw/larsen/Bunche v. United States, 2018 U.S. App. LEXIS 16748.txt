 ORDER
Gary Eugene Bunche, a pro se federal prisoner, appeals the district court's judgment granting summary judgment to the United States on his claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. § 2671, et seq. This case has been referred to a panel of the court that, upon examination, unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).
Bunche is incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky, serving a 210-month sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Bunche has a recurring problem with cellulitis, "a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue marked by discomfort and redness, swelling, and warmth of the infected area." Scott v. Carpenter, 24 F. App'x 645, 647 (8th Cir. 2001). If not treated promptly, cellulitis can quickly spread through the [*2]  body and cause sepsis, "a potentially fatal systemic infection." Newmann v. United States, 938 F.2d 1258, 1260 (5th Cir. 1991); see also Wieckhorst v. Squire, No. 1:10-CV-204, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103606, 2011 WL 4064149, at *4 n.2 (W.D. Mich. Apr. 13, 2011).
At around 10:30 p.m. on July 10, 2013, Bunche told Corrections Officer Hogan that he had a medical emergency because he thought that he had blood poisoning that was connected to his cellulitis, and that he was experiencing a fever, chills, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and pain in his left foot. Hogan called the duty nurse on the telephone and relayed Bunche's complaint, symptoms, and self-diagnosis to her. The nurse wanted to know how Bunche knew what his condition was, and, through Hogan, Bunche explained that his condition was recurrent, that he had experienced it many times in the past, and that the past incidents were documented in his medical file. The nurse, however, refused to examine Bunche and told him to report to sick call the next day, even though it was not a scheduled day for sick call.
The following morning, a physician examined Bunche in the prison's healthcare center and noted Bunche's ill appearance and a wound on his toe that was draining. The doctor ordered that Bunche be transported to the emergency department at a local hospital, with a note to [*3]  "rule out sepsis." There, Bunche was diagnosed with cellulitis of the left lower extremity, and he was admitted for treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Bunche's cellulitis stabilized and improved, and he was discharged two days later with instructions to continue oral antibiotics for ten days.
After exhausting his administrative remedies, Bunche filed suit against the United States under the FTCA, asserting claims for "negligence per se; res ipsa loquitur, and trespass on the case," and not for "medical malpractice by individuals as medical professionals." Bunche's first claim was that the duty nurse denied him emergency medical treatment, thereby subjecting him to pain, anxiety, and impairment of function in his left foot and ankle for over ten hours, kidney damage, and a risk of losing his life. Bunche also alleged that the duty nurse failed to document her encounter with him, as required by statute and regulation. Bunche's second claim was that the Director of Nursing, Mr. Ferrebee, failed to train or instruct the duty nurse on emergency procedures and documenting patient encounters. Bunche's third claim was that Officer Hogan failed to make a record of his encounter with him. [*4]  Among other bases for his claims, Bunche cited 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2), 5 U.S.C. § 552a, 28 C.F.R. § 541.12(4), and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Program Statement 6031.03.
After service of the summons and complaint, but before any discovery had taken place, the government moved to dismiss Bunche's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or in the alternative, for summary judgment under Rule 56. The government argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on what it called Bunche's medical malpractice claim because he did not present any testimony from a medical expert that established that the medical treatment he received fell below the standard of care. The government attached to its motion Bunche's medical records from 2013 through 2016. As for Bunche's other claims, the government argued that it did not have a duty to make a record of its agents' encounters with him, and, in any event, that Bunche could not demonstrate any injury resulting from the failure to make a record.
In response, Bunche argued that he did not need to present expert testimony to prove his first claim because he was not alleging medical malpractice. Instead, observing that § 4042 imposes on the BOP a general duty of safekeeping and care for prisoners, Bunche said that his claim was for [*5]  negligence because he was denied medical care altogether when he presented to the corrections officer and the duty nurse with a medical emergency. Stated another way, according to Bunche, his claim was not about the adequacy of the medical attention he actually received, but rather it was about the denial of the emergency medical treatment that he needed. Additionally, Bunche argued that despite the government's contention to the contrary, whether he was actually experiencing a medical emergency at the time was a disputed issue, as demonstrated by the fact that the doctor ordered him to the emergency room for treatment the next day. Bunche also argued that he did not need a medical expert to support his claim because the duty nurse was not exercising medical judgment when she refused to see him immediately, but to the extent that he needed expert testimony, he pointed out that he had not had the opportunity to take discovery or retain an expert. Finally, Bunche disputed the government's contention that it did not have a duty to him to document his encounters with the prison staff.
The district court treated the government's Rule 12(b)(6) motion as a motion for summary judgment because it submitted [*6]  matters outside of the pleadings in support, and then granted the motion for summary judgment. Also construing Bunche's first claim as a medical malpractice claim, the district court concluded that the government was entitled to summary judgment because Bunche failed to present expert testimony showing that the treatment he received fell below the standard of care. The district court rejected Bunche's argument that he needed discovery in order to respond to the government's motion for summary judgment because he failed to demonstrate how discovery would provide him with the expert evidence he needed. As to his remaining claims, the district court concluded that the BOP did not have a duty to make a record of its encounters with Bunche. The district court therefore granted the government's motion for summary judgment and dismissed Bunche's complaint with prejudice. The court also denied Bunche's Rule 59 motion to alter or amend its judgment.
Bunche filed a timely appeal. Among other issues, Bunche argues that the district court erred in mischaracterizing his first claim, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the government before he could take discovery, and that the [*7]  district court erred in granting summary judgment to the government because there were genuine issues of material fact as to his claims and the court failed to construe the inferences from the record in his favor.
We review de novo a district court's order granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss or a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. See Scott v. Ambani, 577 F.3d 642, 646 (6th Cir. 2009). Summary judgment is appropriate if, viewing the facts and inferences from the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Jones v. City of Franklin, 677 F. App'x 279, 281 (6th Cir. 2017). A district court abuses its discretion if it grants summary judgment to the defendant without giving the plaintiff a full opportunity to conduct discovery. Ball v. Union Carbide Corp., 385 F.3d 713, 719-20 (6th Cir. 2004). An abuse of discretion occurs when the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment. See Burley v. Gagacki, 834 F.3d 606, 617 (6th Cir. 2016).
The FTCA is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for plaintiffs to file state-law tort claims against the United States. See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1); Milligan v. United States, 670 F.3d 686, 692 (6th Cir. 2012). Under the FTCA, the United States is liable where state law would impose liability against a private individual, with liability to be determined according to the law of the [*8]  state where the event giving rise to the claim occurred. See Milligan, 670 F.3d at 692.
Before turning to Kentucky tort law, we must decide what Bunche was actually claiming in his first cause of action with respect to his medical care. As stated, the district court and the government both concluded that Bunche was claiming medical malpractice, and therefore that he needed expert testimony to show that the medical care he received did not meet the standard of care. See Love v. Walker, 423 S.W.3d 751, 756 (Ky. 2014). The government maintains that position in its appellate brief. Bunche, however, has consistently denied that he was bringing a medical malpractice claim and objected to the district court's recharacterization of his claim. Principally citing § 4042(a)(2), Bunche argued that he was asserting a negligence per se claim based on the approximate ten-hour period in which he was denied emergency medical treatment for his cellulitis. Since he was asserting a claim for negligence per se, Bunche argued that he did not need an expert opinion. The general rule is that "the party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon," The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., 228 U.S. 22, 25, 33 S. Ct. 410, 57 L. Ed. 716, 1913 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 530 (1913), and in this case Bunche specifically and consistently denied that he was bringing a medical malpractice claim against the [*9]  government. Accordingly, the district court erred in recasting Bunche's negligence-per-se claim as a medical malpractice claim.
If Bunche is not claiming medical malpractice, the question is whether he has stated a claim for negligence per se. As discussed, Bunche claims that the government violated § 4042(a)(2) when he was denied emergency medical treatment after he reported his cellulitis to the corrections officer. We have recognized that, regardless of any state law duty of care, § 4042(a)(2) imposes upon the BOP a federal duty of care to "provide suitable quarters and provide for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States." Friedman v. United States, No. 99-1445, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, 2000 WL 876391, at *3 (6th Cir. June 21, 2000) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2)). A prisoner may sue the United States under the FTCA if it breaches that duty of care. See 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, [WL] at *2-3. In Friedman, we indicated that the BOP would breach this duty if it negligently failed to provide a prisoner with adequate "sanitary living conditions and proper diet, bedding, and medical treatment." 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, [WL] at *3.
In Jones v. United States, 91 F.3d 623 (3d Cir. 1996), the court held that the BOP would be liable for breaching its duty of care to prisoners under § 4042(a)(2) when prison staff allegedly were negligent in depriving the plaintiff of his blood pressure medication for [*10]  a period of twelve hours, causing him to have a debilitating stroke. See id. at 624-25. The court suggested that the plaintiff did not need expert testimony to prove his claim, stating that evidence that the plaintiff's medication had been withheld and that he subsequently suffered a stroke was sufficient for a jury to conclude that the government breached its duty of care. See id. In view of Friedman and Jones, and construing Bunche's complaint liberally, Luis v. Zang, 833 F.3d 619, 626 (6th Cir. 2016), he sufficiently stated a claim that the government breached its duty of care to him under § 4042(a)(2) when he was denied emergency medical treatment for a ten-hour period.
Even if the duty nurse's decision not to examine Bunche involved medical judgment, he does not necessarily need an expert to prove that the government breached the standard of care. An expert is not needed "if any layman is competent to pass judgment and conclude from common experience that such things do not happen if there has been proper skill and care." Nalley v. Banis, 240 S.W.3d 658, 661 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007) (quoting Perkins v. Hausladen, 828 S.W.2d 652, 655, 39 4 Ky. L. Summary 48 (Ky. 1992)). In Burns v. United States, 542 F. App'x 461, 466-67 (6th Cir. 2013), an FTCA medical malpractice case, we indicated that a layman could determine whether malpractice occurred when the BOP delayed the plaintiff's hernia surgery for two years while he remained in intense pain the entire [*11]  time. Although Bunche's case is not as extreme as Burns, he claims that the delay in treatment caused him to experience excruciating pain and impairment of function; consequently, a layman could conclude that the government breached the standard of care, especially when the nurse allegedly gave no credence to Bunche's complaints and did not bother to examine his injury.
Additionally, expert testimony is not required if "the defendant physician makes admissions of a technical character from which the jury can infer that he acted negligently." Nalley, 240 S.W.3d at 661. Bunche did not have an opportunity to conduct any discovery in this case, and it is possible that in a deposition his treating physician would agree that his reports of his condition were sufficiently credible and urgent that the duty nurse should have examined him immediately rather than put him off until sick call the next day. Indeed, in his Rule 56(d) affidavit, Bunche proposed to depose his treating physician on "his professional opinion on cellulitis; the state of my condition, on 7/11/13; its relation to the delay of treatment; and his knowledge and understanding of the standard of care that nurse Jane Doe was obliged to adhere to, under the circumstances [*12]  of this case." A deposition of the duty nurse might develop this type of evidence as well. Consequently, discovery might reasonably have permitted Bunche to withstand the government's motion for summary judgment. See FTC v. E.M.A. Nationwide, Inc., 767 F.3d 611, 623 (6th Cir. 2014) (stating that a party invoking Rule 56(d) must demonstrate how discovery will permit him to rebut the movant's showing of an absence of a genuine issue of fact). Matthews v. Robinson, 52 F. App'x 808, 810 (6th Cir. 2002), which the government cites for the proposition that Bunche was required to submit the opinion of a medical expert in response to its motion for summary judgment, is distinguishable because the prisoner in that case did not file a Rule 56(d) motion and affidavit in response to the government's motion.
Lastly, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Bunche was experiencing a medical emergency, as shown by the prison physician's decision to send Bunche to the emergency department for treatment upon seeing his condition and his two-day stay in the hospital for the administration of intravenous antibiotics.
In view of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that the district court erred in reframing Bunche's first claim and requiring him to produce an expert opinion when he clearly did not intend to assert a medical malpractice [*13]  claim. Additionally, the district court abused its discretion by requiring Bunche to produce expert testimony and then granting the government's motion for summary judgment without giving him an opportunity to either retain his own expert or to conduct discovery in support of his claim. See CenTra, Inc. v. Estrin, 538 F.3d 402, 420 (6th Cir. 2008) ("Typically, when the parties have [had] no opportunity for discovery, denying the Rule 56[(d)] motion and ruling on a summary judgment motion is likely to be an abuse of discretion."). Finally, the district court erred in granting the government's motion for summary judgment on this claim because there are genuine issues of material fact concerning the severity of Bunche's condition at the time he presented for treatment. Accordingly, we vacate the district court's decision granting summary judgment to the government on Bunche's claim concerning the alleged denial of emergency medical treatment.
Bunche's second claim is for negligent failure to train against Mr. Ferrebee, the Director of Nursing. The district court did not specifically address this claim, and it appears that the court folded it into what it deemed was Bunche's medical malpractice claim. This claim fails to state a claim for relief because [*14]  training and supervising employees is generally a discretionary function that falls outside of the government's limited waiver of sovereign immunity under the FTCA. See Snyder v. United States, 590 F. App'x 505, 509-10 (6th Cir. 2014) (holding that federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction under the FTCA over claims for negligent hiring, training, retention, and supervision of FBI employees). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the government on this claim. See Angel v. Kentucky, 314 F.3d 262, 264 (6th Cir. 2002) ("[W]e are free to affirm the [district court's] judgment on any basis supported by the record.").
Citing the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(1), (2) and (5), Bunche alleged that Corrections Officer Hogan and the duty nurse breached their duty to maintain a record of their encounter with him. The district court granted summary judgment to the government because Bunche failed to cite any authority that required government employees to document his request for medical treatment. The Privacy Act protects an individual from the intentional or willful disclosure of information about him in government records. See Mount v. U.S. Postal Serv., 79 F.3d 531, 533 (6th Cir. 1996); Whyde v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 101 F. App'x 997, 999 (6th Cir. 2004). The Privacy Act, in other words, did not impose upon the BOP a duty to make a record of Bunche's complaint. To the extent that this claim is also based on [*15]  BOP Program Statements concerning recordkeeping, Bunche has not stated a claim for relief. See Flechsig v. United States, 991 F.2d 300, 304 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding that under the FTCA, a claim for negligence per se cannot be based on an alleged violation of a BOP Program Statement). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to the government on this claim.
In summary, we AFFIRM the district court's judgment granting summary judgment to the government on Bunche's first claim to the extent that it was based on the duty nurse's alleged failure to make a record; AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment to the government on Bunche's second and third claims; VACATE the district court's judgment granting summary judgment to the government on Bunche's first claim concerning the alleged denial of emergency medical treatment; and REMAND this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this order.

LARSEN, J., concurring in part and concurring only in the judgment in part. I agree with my colleagues that the district court properly granted the government's motion for summary judgment as to Bunche's failure-to-document and failure-to-train claims. I cannot agree, however, with the majority's [*16]  conclusion that Bunche's claim can proceed without an expert. Yet, because the district court granted summary judgment without affording the plaintiff discovery or time to secure an expert, summary judgment was premature.
A Medical Malpractice Claim. Bunche's claim that he received untimely medical treatment is a claim of medical malpractice and the district court was right to characterize it as such. Bunche contends that the nurse, who heard his reported symptoms and his self-diagnosis, should have known that he could not wait until the next day for treatment. I cannot see how the nurse's assessment that treatment could wait until morning is not conduct involving medical judgment. See Andrew v. Begley, 203 S.W.3d 165, 171 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006) (distinguishing a medical malpractice claim from battery by noting that medical malpractice claims depend on professional judgment or surgical skill). The nurse's assessment may have been based on incomplete facts because she did not personally examine Bunche, but that does not take her conduct out of the realm of medical judgment. Accordingly, Bunche's claim is one for medical malpractice. And, under Kentucky law, most medical malpractice claims cannot proceed without an expert. Adams v. Sietsema, 533 S.W.3d 172, 179 (Ky. 2017).
Negligence per se. [*17]  Although I believe the district court was right to characterize Bunche's claim as one for medical malpractice, Bunche has repeatedly disavowed that characterization. He insists instead that his claim is for negligence per se. The majority accepts this characterization. But understood as negligence per se, Bunche's claim fails as a matter of law. And even if he had stated a claim, he would still need an expert to prove it.
Bunche's claim for negligence per se alleges that the United States is liable for breaching the duty of care outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2). Of course, the "FTCA 'neither creates causes of action against the United States nor provides a means of enforcing federal statutory duties." Premo v. United States, 599 F.3d 540, 544 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Cundiff, 555 F.3d 200, 217 (6th Cir. 2009)). And so, § 4042(a) could only provide the basis for an FTCA suit based on negligence per se if Kentucky law would permit such a suit. Under Kentucky law, however, the violation of a federal statute cannot serve as the basis of a claim of negligence per se. St. Luke Hosp., Inc. v. Straub, 354 S.W.3d 529, 534 (Ky. 2011) (recognizing that Kentucky codified common law negligence per se in Ky. Rev. Stat. § 446.0701  and that "[v]iolations of federal laws and regulations and the laws of other states do not create a cause of action based on KRS 446.070" (footnote omitted)). Accordingly, Bunche cannot proceed [*18]  on a negligence per se theory under the FTCA. See Chomic v. United States, 377 F.3d 607, 611 (6th Cir. 2004) (Under the FTCA, "[s]tate law determines whether there is an underlying cause of action." (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
But even if Kentucky did recognize negligence per se claims based on the violation of a federal statute, it is unclear how Bunche could prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2) divorced from Kentucky tort law. In Kentucky, as elsewhere, "[n]egligence per se . . . 'is . . . a negligence claim with a statutory [or regulatory] standard of care substituted for the common law standard of care.'" Wright v. House of Imports, Inc., 381 S.W.3d 209, 213 (Ky. 2012) (quoting Real Estate Mktg., Inc. v. Franz, 885 S.W.2d 921, 927, 41 11 Ky. L. Summary 35 (Ky. 1994)). In other words, the "negligence per se rule simply recognizes that negligence is proved by showing the violation of a statute aimed at protecting the plaintiff from the kinds of harms she suffered." Dobbs' Law of Torts § 148. "Statutes governing traffic safety are perhaps the most common statutes for application of the negligence per se rule." Id. (citations omitted). Likewise, a "statute may require a lifeguard at a pool, lights on a ship, buildings constructed to specific requirements, safety devices for protection of construction workers, smoke detectors for the protection of tenants; violation [*19]  is negligence per se." Id. (collecting cases); see also Real Estate Mktg., Inc., 885 S.W.2d at 927 ("Thus building code violations, if proved, constitute negligence per se . . . .").
18 U.S.C § 4042(a) is a curious candidate on which to base a claim of negligence per se. Quite unlike the safety statutes referenced above, § 4042(a)(2) states merely that the BOP shall "provide for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States . . . ." The statute offers no substantive standards by which to judge whether the BOP has provided the appropriate "care."
The majority relies on our unpublished decision Friedman v. United States, No. 99-1445, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, 2000 WL 876391 (6th Cir. June 21, 2000), for its conclusion that the BOP breached the level of "care" owed. Friedman, in turn, points to United States v. Muniz, in which the Supreme Court stated that "the duty of care owed by the Bureau of Prisons to federal prisoners is fixed by 18 U.S.C. § 4042, independent of an inconsistent state rule." Friedman, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, 2000 WL 876391 at *2 (quoting Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 164-65, 83 S. Ct. 1850, 10 L. Ed. 2d 805 (1963)). Some exploration of Muniz is therefore in order.
In Muniz, the Supreme Court held that, in the FTCA, "Congress ha[d] clearly consented" to suits by federal prisoners. 374 U.S. at 153. For prisoners, as for all FTCA claimants, "[w]hether a claim could be made out would depend upon whether a private individual under like [*20]  circumstances would be liable under state law." Id.; see also id. at 152 (FTCA recovery depends on whether "'a private person[] would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.'" (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b))). This dependency on state law, however, raised a worry about attempts to "limit suits by federal prisoners because of restrictive state rules of immunity." Id. at 164. "Jailers in some States," the Court noted, "are not liable to their prisoners." Id. In this context, the Court stated that "the duty of care owed by the Bureau of Prisons to federal prisoners is fixed by 18 U.S.C. § 4042, independent of an inconsistent state rule." Id. at 164-65. And so, state immunity law cannot shield federal employees from suit under the FTCA. At the same time, however, the Court confirmed that state law would provide the substantive rules of decision. See id. at 153; see also id. at 162 (noting that, under the FTCA, "[e]ven a matter such as improper medical treatment can be judged under the varying state laws of malpractice without violent dislocation of prison routine" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).
Our court's decision in Friedman clearly understood Muniz this way. After quoting the relevant paragraph from Muniz [*21] , we stated:
Based on this language, we conclude that Friedman need not show that Minnesota law allows prisoners to bring negligence claims against prison officials. Indeed, as the [Supreme] Court explained, Congress has provided an independent federal duty of care by directing the Bureau of Prisons to "provide suitable quarters and provide for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States, or held as witnesses or otherwise." 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2).
Friedman, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, 2000 WL 876391, at *3 (footnote omitted). At the same time, we concluded that "[t]o determine whether the government has breached the federal duty of care set by 18 U.S.C. § 4042, we must look to Minnesota's general negligence principles." Id. Though the "duty of care is set by section 4042," "[i]n order to determine liability, the elements of state tort law must be applied." Id. (citations omitted).
Bunche, therefore, cannot escape Kentucky law. His claim for negligence per se fails as a matter of law because Kentucky does not allow federal statutes to provide the basis for such claims. But even if Kentucky would allow § 4042(a) to serve as the basis for a claim of negligence per se, "[i]n order to determine liability, the elements of state tort law [*22]  must be applied." Id. (citations omitted). And under Kentucky law, Bunche would need an expert.
Expert Witness. Under Kentucky law, Bunche was required to provide expert testimony. The Kentucky Supreme Court has explained that:
[m]ost medical malpractice claims involve issues of science or professional skill outside the ordinary experiences and range of knowledge of typical jurors and judges. For that reason, most, but certainly not all, medical malpractice claims cannot be proven without expert opinion testimony to establish that the conduct in question departed from the applicable standard of care and was a proximate cause of the damages claimed.
Adams, 533 S.W.3d at 179 (citations omitted). Expert testimony is not needed, however, in two kinds of cases: (1) "in res ipsa loquitur cases, where the jury may reasonably infer both negligence and causation from the mere occurrence of the event and the defendant's relation to it," and (2) "in cases where the defendant physician makes certain admissions that make his negligence apparent." Blankenship v. Collier, 302 S.W.3d 665, 670 (Ky. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Bunche invokes the first of these exceptions—res ipsa loquitur. A res ipsa loquitur case is one in which "'any layman is competent [*23]  to pass judgment and conclude from common experience that such things do not happen if there has been proper skill and care'; illustrated by cases where the surgeon leaves a foreign object in the body or removes or injures an inappropriate part of the anatomy." Perkins v. Hausladen, 828 S.W.2d 652, 655, 39 4 Ky. L. Summary 48 (Ky. 1992) (quoting Prosser and Keeton on Torts, § 39 (5th ed. 1984)). This is not such a case.
Here, Bunche's treatment was delayed by approximately ten hours. Bunche claims the delay was medically negligent and caused him to suffer anxiety, pain, impairment in the function of his left foot and ankle, and kidney damage. Without expert testimony, however, a reasonable layperson could not conclude that Bunche's self-diagnosis of cellulitis, even combined with his self-reported symptoms ("fever, chills, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and pain in left foot"), required immediate medical intervention; nor could a reasonable layperson conclude that Bunche would not have suffered from his alleged injuries even with immediate medical treatment. Applying Kentucky law, our district courts have held that "these kinds of 'delay-based allegations . . . are fundamentally different from a surgeon leaving a foreign object in a person or operating on the wrong [*24]  part of the body." Gonzalez v. United States, No. 17-270-DLB, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30022, 2018 WL 1050454, *3-4 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 26, 2018) (quoting Earle v. United States, No. 6:13-cv-184, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50374, 2016 WL 8814363, *6 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 8, 2016)); see also Jones v. Gaes, No. 2009-SC-000780-DG, 2011 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 40, 2011 WL 1642225, at *3 (Ky. Apr. 21, 2011) ("Absent expert testimony, a layperson is not competent to determine whether the alleged delay by Dr. Jones in recognizing and treating Gaes's perforated colon was the proximate cause of her pain and suffering, the colostomy procedure, or her ongoing medical problems."). The district court was right that Bunche needed expert testimony to establish his claim.2 
But even so, summary judgment was prematurely granted in this case. "The general rule is that summary judgment is improper if the non-movant is not afforded a sufficient opportunity for discovery." Vance v. United States, 90 F.3d 1145, 1148 (6th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). Here, Bunche was afforded no opportunity for discovery, despite specifically naming individuals, including his treating physicians, that he believed could serve as expert witnesses. Bunche should have had an opportunity to depose his treating physicians. It is possible that one of his own doctors would testify to the standard of treatment for his condition and to whether, in his expert opinion, that standard was breached [*25]  in this case. See id. ("[T]he necessary expert testimony may be supplied by the defendant's admissions during discovery, or through medical evidence obtained from other treating physicians." (citing Perkins, 828 S.W.2d at 655-56)).
* * *
I concur in the majority's opinion and judgment affirming the district court's decision to grant summary judgment as to Bunche's failure-to-document and failure-to-train claims. But I disagree with the majority's conclusion that Bunche's claim for delayed medical treatment can proceed without an expert. Yet, because the district court granted summary judgment without affording the plaintiff discovery or time to secure an expert, summary judgment was improper at this time. Accordingly, I respectfully concur only in the judgment with respect to this claim.
