Dissent




WEAVER, J. (dissenting).
I dissent from the order granting the request of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for an answer to the question, because I continue to question this Court's constitutional authority to hear questions certified by other courts. 1  [*1117]  Justice YOUNG 2  and Justice LEVIN 3  have also questioned this Court's authority to answer certified questions. Therefore, I  [***2] would decline to answer the question in this case.
YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
I would decline to answer the certified question. I continue to adhere to my stated position in In re Certified Question (Wayne Co v Philip Morris Inc), 622 NW2d 518 (Mich, 2001), that this Court lacks the authority under state law to answer certified questions. However, this position has failed to carry the day. See Proposed Amendment of MCR 7.305, 462 Mich 1208 (2000). As the final arbiter of state  [***3] law, this Court has concluded that it has the authority to answer certified questions. Accordingly, while this Court may exercise that authority, I will exercise careful discretion before answering any certified question. I would decline to answer the question in this instance.
