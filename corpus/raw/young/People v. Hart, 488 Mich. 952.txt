Opinion




  [*823]  Order
On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal the June 8, 2010 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered and, pursuant to MCR 7.302(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we VACATE the defendant's convictions for child sexually abusive activity under MCL 750.145c(2), and we REMAND this case to the Wayne Circuit Court for entry of judgments of conviction for possession of child sexually abusive material and resentencing under MCL 750.145c(4). People v Hill, 486 Mich 658; 786 N.W.2d 601 (2010). In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.
We do not retain jurisdiction.

Concur




 [*824]  CORRIGAN, J. (concurring).
I concur in the order vacating defendant's convictions under MCL 750.145c(2) because this course of action is consistent with the majority opinion in People v Hill, 486 Mich 658; 786 N.W.2d 601 (2010).  [**2] I write separately only to reiterate my disagreement with that majority opinion--which I conclude incorrectly interpreted MCL 750.145c(2)--as expressed by Justice YOUNG's dissenting opinion in Hill, which I joined.
YOUNG, J. (concurring).
While I recognize that People v Hill, 486 Mich 658; 786 N.W.2d 601 (2010), controls the outcome in this case, I continue to adhere to my dissenting opinion in Hill.
KELLY, C.J., would grant leave to appeal.
