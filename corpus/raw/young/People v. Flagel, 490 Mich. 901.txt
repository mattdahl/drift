Young, C.J. (concurring).
In this case, the 75-year-old defendant sexually assaulted the 8-year-old victim over the course of a year. He pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree. At sentencing, defendant was scored 15 points under offense variable 8 (OV 8) for asportation of a victim to a place of greater danger because he took the victim to his hot tub or isolated places on the beach in order to sexually assault her. On appeal here, defendant argues that the trial court erred in assessing these points, relying on this Court's order in People v Thompson, which held that where movement of a victim is "incidental to commission of the crime," it does not amount to asportation.1 
As I stated in Thompson: there is no "bedroom exception" to OV 8, and thus even where a defendant takes a victim to places that are "traditionally favored location[s] for sexual activity," he may still be assessed points pursuant to OV 8 if that asportation is to a place or situation of greater danger.2  Contrary to defendant's view, this Court's order in Thompson should not be read as having created a categorical new exception to OV 8 covering favored locations for sexual activity, such as a bedroom or, apparently, a hot tub or isolated place at the beach.
Because defendant took the victim to places of greater danger where others were less likely to discover defendant committing the sexual assaults, he was appropriately assessed 15 points under OV 8.
