Opinion




  [*1067]   [**407]  Order
On order of the Court, the motion to expand the record is DENIED. The application for leave to appeal the March 31, 2009 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is GRANTED. The parties shall include among the issues to be briefed: (1) whether defendant Merit Energy Company could be conveyed or granted the right to discharge water on land owned by the state; (2) what test should be applied to determine whether and the extent to which Merit may discharge water; (3) whether the plaintiffs have a cause of action under the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, MCL 324.1701(1), against defendant Department of Environmental Quality; and (4) whether Michigan Citizens v Nestle Waters, 479 Mich 280, 737 N.W.2d 447 (2007), and Preserve the Dunes v DEQ, 471 Mich 508, 684 N.W.2d 847 (2004), were correctly decided.
The motions for leave to file brief amicus curiae are GRANTED. Other persons or groups interested in the determination  [***2] of the issues presented in this case may move the Court for permission to file briefs amicus curiae.

Dissent




YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent from the order granting leave in this case and instead would deny leave to appeal. The order directs the parties to discuss whether Michigan Citizens v Nestle Waters 1  [*1068]  and Preserve the Dunes v DEQ 2  were correctly decided. I believe both cases were correctly decided. While it is certainly the prerogative of the Court to do so, this order is another instance where the majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare decisis. 3  
 [**408]  Since the shift in the Court's philosophical majority in January 2009, the majority has pointedly sought out precedents only recently decided 4  [*1069]  and has failed to give effect to other recent precedents of this Court. 5  Today, the Court again orders reconsideration of two cases that were decided just three and six years ago. Nothing in the law of this State or the rationale of those decisions has changed in this short time. Accordingly, as I have in other similar orders, 6  I respectfully dissent from this order.
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
