Opinion




  [*214]  Order
On order of the Court, the motion for reconsideration is considered, and it is DENIED.
Concur by: Robert P. Young, Jr.  
Concur




Young, C.J. (concurring).
I concur in this order of denial because I believe that this motion for reconsideration was entirely meritless and vexatious. I would, therefore, have sanctioned both the plaintiff and his attorney $1,000 for violating MCR 7.316(D).
