Dissent




Young, C.J. (dissenting).
I would grant reconsideration and, upon reconsideration, grant leave to appeal. This is an important case for the jurisprudence of this state, implicating principles of standing and the statutory interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act, and the bench and bar would benefit from a decision of this Court following full briefing and oral argument.
 [*977]  Markman, J., would grant the motion for reconsideration and, on reconsideration, would grant leave to appeal.
