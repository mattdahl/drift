Opinion




  [*487]  Order
By order of October 26, 2009, the application for leave to appeal the May 28, 2009 judgment of the Court of Appeals was held in abeyance pending the decision in McCormick v Carrier (Docket No. 136738). On order of the Court, the case having been decided on July 31, 2010, 487 Mich 180, 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1654 (2010), the application is again considered and, pursuant to MCR 7.302(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we VACATE the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the Monroe Circuit Court, and we REMAND this case to the trial court for reconsideration in light of McCormick.

Concur




CORRIGAN, J. (concurring).
I concur in the order remanding for reconsideration under McCormick v Carrier, 487 Mich 180, 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1654 (2010), because the majority opinion in McCormick altered the criteria for determining whether an injured plaintiff meets the serious impairment threshold in MCL 500.3135(7). But I reiterate my disagreement with the McCormick majority's  [**2] analysis for the reasons expressed in Justice MARKMAN's dissent in that case, which I joined. I continue to conclude that the McCormick majority misinterpreted MCL 500.3135(7), thus encouraging litigation that is expressly prohibited by the motor vehicle no-fault insurance act and upsetting the Legislature's clear intent to provide Michigan citizens with timely, automatic benefits for injuries sustained in auto accidents while avoiding costly, unnecessary litigation.
YOUNG, J. (concurring).
Although I recognize that this Court's decision in McCormick v Carrier, 487 Mich 180, 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1654 (2010), now controls when a person may recover in tort for non-economic loss under the no-fault act, I continue to adhere to the position stated in Justice MARKMAN's dissenting opinion in that case, which I joined.
