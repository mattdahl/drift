Opinion




  [*1070]   [**410]  Order
On order of the Court, the motion for leave to file a brief amicus curiae is GRANTED. The application for leave to appeal the June 18, 2009 judgment of the Court of Appeals and the application for leave to appeal as cross-appellants are considered. The application for leave to appeal is GRANTED. The parties shall address whether Trentadue v Buckler Automatic Lawn Sprinkler Co, 479 Mich. 378, 738 N.W.2d 664 (2007), was correctly decided. The application for leave to appeal as cross-appellants remains pending.
The Negligence Section of the State Bar of Michigan and the Michigan Defense Trial Counsel, Inc. are invited to file briefs amicus curiae. Other persons or groups interested in the determination of the issues presented in this case may move the Court for permission to file briefs amicus curiae.

Dissent




YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent from the order granting leave in this case and instead would deny leave to appeal. The majority has accepted plaintiff's request  [***2] to consider whether Trentadue v Buckler Automatic Lawn Sprinkler Co 1  was correctly decided. I believe that case was correctly decided. While it is certainly the prerogative of the Court to reconsider this case, this order is another instance where the majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare decisis. 2  
 [*1071]   [**411]  Since the shift in the Court's philosophical majority in January 2009, the majority has pointedly sought out precedents only recently decided 3  and has  [***4] failed to give effect to other recent precedents of this Court. 4  [*1072]  Today, the Court again orders reconsideration of a case that was decided less than three years ago. Nothing in the law of this State or the rationale of that decision has changed in this short time. Accordingly, as I have in other similar orders, 5  I respectfully dissent from this order.
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
