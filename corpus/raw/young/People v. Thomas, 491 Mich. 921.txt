2012 Mich. LEXIS 707 *; 491 Mich. 921; 812 N.W.2d 748; 2012 WL 1853852
 PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, Plaintiff-Appellee, v JAMIL WILLIAM THOMAS, Defendant-Appellant.  
Prior History:  [*1] COA: 299917; 299918. Washtenaw CC: 09-001956-FH; 09-001957-FH.
People v. Thomas, 2011 Mich. App. LEXIS 2209 (Mich. Ct. App., Dec. 13, 2011)  
Judges: Robert P. Young, Jr., Chief Justice. Michael F. Cavanagh, Marilyn Kelly, Stephen J. Markman, Diane M. Hathaway, Mary Beth Kelly, Brian K. Zahra, Justices. YOUNG, C.J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).  
Opinion




 Order
On order of the Court, the motion for miscellaneous relief is GRANTED. The application for leave to appeal the December 13, 2011 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court. The defendant pleaded guilty to four offenses, three of which were crimes against a person; thus, even if the conspiracy conviction is not counted, see People v Bonilla-Machado, 489 Mich 412; 803 N.W.2d 217 (2011), offense variable 13 was still correctly scored at 25 points for three crimes against a person within a five-year period.

Dissent




Young, C.J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).
I concur in the Court's decision to deny defendant's application for leave to appeal because OV 13 was correctly scored at 25 points. I do not support the portion of the order that indicates defendant's  [*2] conspiracy conviction was not a crime against a person for purposes of OV 13 for the reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in People v Bonilla-Machado, 489 Mich 412, 441-450; 803 N.W.2d 217 (2011).
