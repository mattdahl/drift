Opinion




 [**500]   [*963]  On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal the November 24, 2009 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered. We direct the Clerk to schedule oral argument on whether to grant the application or take other peremptory action. MCR 7.302(H)(1). At oral argument, the parties shall address whether this Court should reconsider Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197; 731 N.W.2d 41 (2007). They may file supplemental briefs within 42 days of the date of this order, but they should not submit mere restatements of their application papers.
The Michigan Association for Justice and the Michigan Defense Trial Counsel, Inc. are invited to file briefs amicus curiae. Other persons or groups interested in the determination of the issue presented in this case may move the Court for permission to file briefs amicus curiae.

Dissent




YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent from the order directing further argument on the  [***2] application for leave to appeal in this case and instead would deny leave to appeal. The order directs the parties to discuss whether this Court should reconsider Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm'n. 1  I believe Rowland was correctly decided. While it is certainly the prerogative of the Court to reconsider that decision, this order is another instance where the majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare decisis. 2  
 [**501]   [*964]  Since the shift in the Court's philosophical majority in January 2009, the majority has pointedly sought out precedents only recently decided, 3  [*965]  has failed to give effect to other recent precedents, 4  and has outright overturned other recent precedents of this Court. 5  I can only assume that the majority is making good on our Chief Justice's pledge she made shortly before the shift in the Court's philosophical majority:
We the new majority will get the ship off the shoals and back on course, and we will undo a great deal of the damage that the Republican-dominated court has done. Not only will we not neglect our duties, we will not sleep on the bench. 6 
 [**502]  Today, the Court again orders reconsideration of a case that was decided just three years ago. Nothing in the law of this State or the rationale of that decision has changed in this short time. Accordingly, as I have in other similar orders, 7  I respectfully dissent from this order.
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
