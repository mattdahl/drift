Opinion




  [*870]   [**773] Order
By order of October 26, 2009, the application for leave to appeal the July 1, 2009 order of the Court of Appeals was held in abeyance pending the decision in Hoover v Michigan Mutual Ins Co (Docket No. 138018). On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal in Hoover having been dismissed on January 15, 2010, 485 Mich. 1036, 776 N.W.2d 895 (2010), the application is again considered, and it is GRANTED. The parties shall include among the issues to be briefed whether, or to what extent, the defendant is obligated to pay the plaintiffs personal protection insurance benefits under the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 et seq., for housing expenses, modifications, and accommodations associated with the care of the plaintiffs' son, Isaac Wilcox, and whether Griffith v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, 472 Mich 521; 697 N.W.2d 895 (2005), was correctly decided. The motion for leave to participate as amicus curiae filed by the Coalition Protecting  [***2] Auto No-Fault is  [**774]  GRANTED. We further ORDER that the stay entered by this Court on October 26, 2009 remains in effect until completion of this appeal.

Dissent




YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent from the order in this case and instead would deny leave to appeal. The order directs the parties to discuss whether Griffith v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co 1  was correctly decided. I believe it was correctly decided. While it is certainly the prerogative of the Court to reconsider this case, this order is another instance where the majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare decisis. 2  
 [*871]  Since the shift in the Court's philosophical majority in January 2009, the majority has pointedly sought out precedents only recently decided 3   [*872]  and has failed to give  [**775]  effect to other recent precedents of this Court. 4  Today, the Court again orders reconsideration of a case that was decided just five years ago. It should be obvious to all but the most casual observer of the Court that a pattern is being established: the new majority is intent on "revisiting" (overruling) the decisions of the last ten years. Ironically, its consistent signals to the Bar that the jurisprudence of the last decade is in play seems an unnecessary prod to those who would eagerly return to the days when "judicial policy," rather than the language of the statute, ruled.
Other than the change in the composition of this Court in 2009,  [***7] nothing in the law of this State or the rationale of that decision has changed in this short time. Accordingly, as I have in other similar orders, 5  I respectfully dissent from this order.
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
