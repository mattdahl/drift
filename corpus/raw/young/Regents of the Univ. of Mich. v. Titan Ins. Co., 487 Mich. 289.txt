Opinion




 [**898]  [*292]   KELLY, C.J.
We examine whether MCL 600.5821(4), which preserves state entities' rights to bring certain claims, also preserves the right to seek recovery of all damages incurred notwithstanding the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). We hold that MCL 600.5821(4) exempts the state entities it lists from the  [*293]  one-year-back rule. As a consequence, we overrule Liptow v State Farm Mut Ins Co, 1  which held to the contrary, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We also overrule Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 2  on which the Liptow decision relied exclusively in reaching its conclusion.
 [**899]  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Nicholas  [***2] Morgan was severely injured in an automobile accident in March 2000. He was treated at the University of Michigan Health System for six days. Less than one year after the accident, Morgan sought personal protection insurance benefits through the Michigan Assigned Claims Facility (MACF). Because he was not covered under a no-fault insurance policy, the MACF designated Titan Insurance Company as the servicing insurer for his claims. In January 2006, the University of Michigan Health System and the university's regents filed this lawsuit against Titan, seeking payment from defendant for Morgan's medical treatment. Plaintiffs sought reimbursement of the full cost of Morgan's hospitalization, which they alleged was $ 69,957.19.
Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing that the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1) 3  barred plaintiffs from recovering the claimed damages. Plaintiffs countered that MCL 600.5821(4) 4  allows the state and its political subdivisions to file suit without limitation  [*294]  and entirely supersedes MCL 500.3145(1). They asserted that MCL 600.5821(4) exempts certain suits brought by public entities from "the statute of limitations" and allows initiation of such actions  [***3] "at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding." The trial court agreed with defendant and dismissed the suit.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in a divided decision. 5  The majority concluded that, under MCR 7.215(J)(1), it was bound to follow the Liptow decision and uphold the trial court. Judge DAVIS agreed that Liptow was controlling, but opined that it had been wrongly  [***4] decided and that the Court should convene a conflict panel pursuant to MCR 7.215(J)(2) and (3). Initially, we denied leave to appeal, 6  but on reconsideration, we vacated the denial order, granted reconsideration, and granted leave to appeal. 7  
MCL 600.5851(1)-THE MINORITY/INSANITY PROVISION
An analysis of this Court's rulings on the issues implicated in this case naturally begins with Lambert v  [*295]  Calhoun. 8  Lambert held that MCL 600.5851(1) 9  preserves  [**900]  a claim by a minor or incompetent person even though the statute of limitations in the act under which the claim is brought bars the action.
Four years later, the Court of Appeals in Rawlins v Aetna Cas & Surety Co followed Lambert. 10  It held that MCL 600.5851(1) preserves a no-fault claim by a minor even though it would otherwise be barred by the limitations period in the no-fault act.
Shortly after, in Geiger v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, 11  the Court of Appeals held that MCL 600.5851(1) preserves a claim by a minor or incompetent person for personal protection insurance benefits even though it would otherwise be barred by the one-year-back rule. Geiger remained the prevailing law in this state for the next 24 years.
CAMERON AND LIPTOW
In 2006, in Cameron, this Court overruled Geiger in a 4 to 3 decision. The majority held that the minority/insanity provision in MCL 600.5851(1) did not remove the plaintiff's claim from application of the one-year-back  [***6] rule. The analysis stated:
 [*296]  By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a minor or person suffering from insanity may "make the entry or bring the action." It does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). 12 
Accordingly, the majority held that a statute governing when a party may bring an action does not affect the damages recoverable under the one-year-back rule.
In Liptow, the Court of Appeals examined the interplay of the one-year-back rule and MCL 600.5821(4). Relying solely on Cameron, it stated:
Thus, the pertinent question is whether the damages-limiting portion of MCL 500.3145(1), the one-year-back rule, limits the [claimant's] recovery. This Court's ruling in Univ of Michigan Regents [v State Farm Mut Ins Co, 250 Mich App 719, 733, 650 NW2d 129 (2002)] is of no assistance in this determination. The issue appears to be one of first impression.
MCL 600.5821(4) provides  [***7] that actions brought by the state or its subdivisions to recover the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in state institutions "are not subject to the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding." We conclude that, by the plain import of this language, the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be brought at any time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any other limiting provisions. In other words, like  [**901]  the minority tolling provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the time during which the state  [*297]  may bring an action; it "does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has been brought." Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 62. Accordingly, we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 61-62. Therefore, we hold that defendant is liable to the [claimant] only for costs it incurred  [***8] for [the patient's] care, maintenance, and treatment in state institutions within one year before the filing of the complaint. 13 
ANALYSIS
This case presents questions of statutory interpretation which are reviewed de novo. 14  
No party disputes that MCL 600.5821(4) preserves plaintiffs' right to bring the instant cause of action. The question before us is whether MCL 500.3145(1) restricts plaintiffs' recovery to damages incurred one year before plaintiffs filed suit. The answer turns on the correct understanding of the interaction between MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5821(4). It is undisputed that all of plaintiffs' costs were incurred between March 18 and March 23, 2000. Thus, if the one-year-back rule applies to their claim, plaintiffs are entitled to no damages.
Defendant relies on Liptow, which held that the one-year-back rule governs actions to which MCL 600.5821(4) applies because the statute does not exempt state entities from its limitation on damages. We disagree.
Defendant's argument and the holding in Liptow rest on a fundamentally incorrect premise. Liptow reasoned  [*298]   [***9] that (1) MCL 600.5821(4) exempts state entities from any statute of limitations, (2) the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1) is not a statute of limitations, but a damages limitation, and therefore (3) MCL 600.5821(4) does not exempt a governmental entity from the one-year-back-rule of MCL 500.3145(1). 15  This premise is derived from our decision in Cameron. Therefore, we are required to revisit Cameron's analysis.
The Cameron majority concluded that actions brought pursuant to MCL 600.5851(1) are subject to the one-year-back rule because that statute does not implicate when a plaintiff may "bring an action." We conclude that the statutory language in MCL 600.5851(1) and MCL 500.3145(1) does not command the conclusion that the Cameron majority reached.
To begin with, we conclude that the approach in Cameron was flawed because it read the statutory language in isolation. MCL 600.5851(1) does not create its own independent cause of action. It must be read together with the statute under which the plaintiff seeks to recover. In no-fault cases, for example, MCL 600.5851(1) must be read together with MCL 500.3145(1). Doing so, the statutes grant infants and  [***10] incompetent persons one year after their disability is removed to "bring the action" "for recovery of personal protection insurance benefits . . . for accidental bodily injury . . . ." On the basis of its language, MCL 600.5851(1) supersedes all limitations  [**902]  in MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-back rule's limitation on the period of recovery. 16  
 [*299]  For what purpose might a plaintiff "bring an action"? Surely not for the sole satisfaction of filing papers in court. A plaintiff brings a tort action to recover damages. Although the right to bring an action would be a hollow one indeed if a plaintiff could not recover damages, Cameron and Liptow limited a plaintiff to just that hollow right. Therefore, we restore the proper understanding of the interaction between MCL 600.5851(1) and the one-year-back rule. We hold that the "action" and "claim" preserved by MCL 600.5851(1) include the right to collect damages. As Justice CAVANAGH explained in his dissenting opinion in Cameron,
[t]he word "claim" has been discussed  [***11] by this Court many times over the past century. For instance, in Allen v Bd of State Auditors, 122 Mich 324, 81 NW 113 (1899), this Court noted the following definition of the word "claim": "'[A] demand of a right or alleged right; a calling on another for something due or asserted to be due; as, a claim of wages for services.'" Id. at 328, citing Cent Dict. In In re Chamberlain's Estate, 298 Mich 278, 299 NW 82 (1941), this Court explained that "'[t]he word "claims" is "by authorities generally construed as referring to demands of a pecuniary nature and which could have been enforced against the deceased in his lifetime."'" Id. at 285, quoting In re Quinney's Estate, 287 Mich 329, 333, 283 NW 599 (1939), quoting Knutsen v Krook, 111 Minn 352, 357, 127 NW 11 (1910). More recently, in CAM Constr v Lake Edgewood Condo Ass'n, 465 Mich 549, 554-555, 640 NW2d 256 (2002), this Court set forth the legal definitions of the term:
"1. The aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable by a court . . . . 2. The assertion of an existing right; any right to payment or to an equitable remedy, even if contingent or provisional . . . . 3. A demand for money or property to which one  [***12] asserts a right . . . . [Black's Law Dictionary (7th ed).]"
 [*300]  In short, then, a claim means a "demand[] of a pecuniary nature," a "right to payment," and a "demand for money." 17 
Justice CAVANAGH's dissent is equally applicable here. The statute at issue in this case, MCL 600.5821(4), also addresses "[a]ctions." Specifically, it preserves actions brought by state entities. It also explicitly delineates that the action contemplated is one brought for the recovery for certain costs incurred. MCL 600.5821(4) lists the costs as those for the "maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in hospitals, homes, schools, and other state institutions . . . ." Thus, it is apparent from the language of the statute that the Legislature intended to preserve more than the state entities' right to file papers in court.
Moreover, this Court's caselaw predating Cameron also does not support the Cameron majority's holding. The only authority cited for Cameron's interpretation was in Justice MARKMAN's concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from Justice BRICKLEY's lead opinion in Howard v Gen M otors Corp. 18  
 [**903]  In Howard, two justices analyzed the one-year-back rule in the workers' compensation act to determine  [*301]  whether it was a jurisdictional affirmative defense akin to a statute of limitations. Justice BRICKLEY concluded that "the 'statute of limitations' interpretation of the one-year-back rule offered in Kleinschrodt 19  and applied to the two-year-back rule in Kingery 20  and Howard [in the Court of Appeals] contradicts our earlier precedent on the subject as well as the plain language  [***14] of the statutes." 21  By contrast, in Kleinschrodt, five justices stated that "[w]e are of the opinion that the one-year-back provision is a defense, akin to the statute of limitations . . . ." 22  
In sum, for more than 20 years before Cameron, the majority in all of the Court's relevant opinions saw no basis for treating any of the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1) differently. In Welton v Carriers Ins Co, we made a distinction among the provisions only to the extent of noting that the section contains "two limitations on time of suit and one limitation on period of recovery[.]" 23  Even then, the Welton Court saw no basis for treating the provisions differently. 24  Indeed, the law was so well settled that the defendants in Cameron did not even argue for different treatment until this Court heard oral argument on appeal. 25  
 [*302]  Thus, we conclude that Cameron erroneously held that MCL 600.5851(1) does not protect a plaintiff's claim from the one-year-back rule. We also hold that this understanding of the interaction between the statutes is equally applicable to the interaction between MCL 600.5821(4) and MCL 500.3145(1). Therefore, the provisions of MCL 600.5821(4) preserving a plaintiff's right to bring an action also preserve the plaintiff's right to recover damages incurred more than one year before suit is filed. The one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) is inapplicable to such claims. 26  
 [**904]  STARE DECISIS 27  
For the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that  [*303]  Cameron was wrongly decided. However, despite the fact that a previous decision was wrongly decided, we must be mindful of the doctrine of stare decisis when deciding whether to overrule it. 28  Our analysis always begins with a presumption that upholding precedent is the preferred course of action. 29  That presumption should be retained until effectively rebutted by the conclusion that a compelling justification exists to overturn it. 30  Nonetheless, when analyzing precedent that itself represents a recent departure from established caselaw, we apply a decreased presumption in favor of upholding precedent. 31  
In determining whether a compelling justification exists to overturn precedent, the Court may consider numerous evaluative criteria, none of which, standing alone, is dispositive. Historically, courts have considered (1) whether the precedent has proved to be intolerable  [*304]  because it defies practical workability, (2) whether reliance on it is  [***19] such that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity, (3) whether related principles of law have so far developed since the precedent was pronounced that no more than a remnant of it has survived, (4) whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the precedent of significant application or justification, (5) whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a different manner, (6) whether upholding the precedent is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests,  [**905]  and (7) whether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from then existing precedent.
These factors may or may not be applicable in a given case. Nor is there a magic number of factors that must favor overruling a case in order to establish the requisite compelling justification. Rather, this conclusion should be reached on a case-by-case basis.
Here, we first consider whether Cameron has proved intolerable because it defies practical workability. Indeed it does. Cameron left MCL 600.5851(1) and similar provisions void of effect in many cases while ostensibly protecting an injured party's right to  [***20] file suit. This created an indefensible paradox and, as such, an unworkable and confusing legal landscape. Consider, for example, the hypothetical case of a boy injured in a car accident at age 12 and fully recovered by age 15. Upon reaching 18, he retains an attorney to file suit to recover the costs associated with the treatment of his injuries, relying on MCL 600.5851(1). The defendant also retains counsel, who responds by filing a motion to dismiss, arguing that none of the plaintiff's damages are recoverable. The trial court parses the parties' filings and determines that none of the plaintiff's costs were incurred in the year before suit was filed.
 [*305]  Under Cameron, the plaintiff in this hypothetical case was indisputably entitled to file suit, because MCL 600.5851(1) preserved his right to do so. Yet Cameron gutted his suit of any practical worth because, under its interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1), the plaintiff had no chance to recover any damages. Thus, the plaintiff was denied the legal recourse the Legislature provided him, which is, after reaching his majority, to recover the damages he incurred more than a year earlier. Accordingly, we conclude that Cameron is frequently  [***21] innately unworkable.
Second, we consider whether reliance interests weigh in favor of overruling Cameron. We conclude that they do. Cameron is of recent vintage, having been decided a mere four years ago. Hence, reliance on its holding has been of limited duration. Moreover, Cameron represented a sea change in one area of the law and toppled settled interpretations of the no-fault act that had existed almost since the adoption of MCL 600.5851. 32  In doing so, Cameron disrupted the reliance interests of the injured minors and the incompetents who relied on its provisions to preserve their claims until removal of their disabilities.
We recognize that there exists a competing reliance interest in the continuing validity of Cameron: that of the defendants in no-fault cases. Yet Cameron's evisceration of the crux of a plaintiff's claim-the potential to recover damages--effectively removed altogether the incentive to file suit as permitted by MCL 600.5851(1). We conclude that, while no-fault defendants' reliance on this interpretation is reasonable, it is not itself sufficient to preclude overruling Cameron given the extent of Cameron's prejudice to no-fault plaintiffs.
 [*306]  Third,  [***22] we consider whether related principles of law have developed since Cameron's interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1) was pronounced. This factor is inapplicable to our stare decisis analysis in this case, as we are aware of no intervening change in the law that further supports or undermines Cameron's continuing legitimacy.
Fourth, we examine whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or have come to be seen so differently, that Cameron  [**906]  has been robbed of significant justification. Like the previous factor, we discern no factual or circumstantial changes that counsel for or against overruling Cameron. Therefore, this factor also is inapplicable to our analysis.
Fifth, we consider whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a different manner. This factor is likewise inapplicable to our stare decisis analysis. Michigan's comprehensive no-fault insurance scheme is unique to our state. While other states share the fundamental underpinnings of our system, judicial interpretations of the no-fault act have evolved independently of those of other states with similar insurance schemes. Thus, other jurisdictions' interpretations of similar statutes are unhelpful to our analysis  [***23] in this case.
Sixth, we examine whether upholding Cameron is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests. We conclude that this factor weighs heavily in favor of overruling Cameron. Cameron drastically curtailed the protection provided by the Legislature for minors and incompetents. In enacting MCL 600.5851(1), the Legislature conveyed its intention to protect individuals in those groups with unique treatment under the law. The statute represents the culmination of the Legislature's deliberative process. Cameron undermined the Legislature's decision to provide a  [*307]  "year of grace" to infants and incompetents in recognition of their inability to legally act until their disabilities are removed. 33  
Moreover, Cameron set an ironic trap for minors and incompetents.  [***24] As Justice CAVANAGH astutely noted in dissent:
[I]f a person is injured in a motor vehicle accident while an infant or legally incompetent, and his injuries resolve a year or more before his disability resolves, then [Cameron's] interpretation of MCL 500.3145(1) will completely preclude that person from recovering any of the damages incurred from the accident, and, thus completely abrogate his claim. 34 
Thus, what the Legislature intended as a provision to preserve a plaintiff's claims, Cameron rendered largely meaningless. In certain circumstances, Cameron's interpretation of the saving provision actually operates to extinguish a claim, not save it.
Finally, we consider whether Cameron represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent. We conclude that this factor also weighs heavily in favor of overruling Cameron. Cameron overruled Geiger, 35  a Court of Appeals case interpreting the interplay between the saving provision and the no-fault  [*308]  act. Geiger was decided in 1982 and stood as the seminal interpretation of the one-year-back rule until Cameron unexpectedly swept it aside 24 years later. 36  
 [**907]  Furthermore, as noted, a majority of this Court had concluded before Cameron that the one-year-back rule does not apply to claims preserved by tolling. We made this decision even though in Welton we described the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1) as "two limitations on time of suit and one limitation on period of recovery[.]" 37  To the extent that Cameron held otherwise, it also implicitly overruled Welton. Thus, we are firmly convinced that Cameron represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent.
In summary, Cameron is often unworkable, has not engendered valid reliance interests, has caused serious detriment prejudicial to public interests, and represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent. Accordingly, we conclude that a compelling justification exists for overruling it. 38  
CONCLUSION
We overrule our decision in Cameron and the Court of Appeals' decision in Liptow. Entities listed in MCL 600.5821(4) may bring an action and recover costs notwithstanding the limiting provisions of MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-back rule.  [*309]  Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

WEAVER, J. (concurring).
I concur in and sign all of the majority opinion except the section entitled "Stare Decisis." I write separately to note that in addition to the reasons given in the majority opinion, I also believe that Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 476 Mich 55, 718 NW2d 784 (2006),  [***27] should be overruled for the reasons in my dissent to the Cameron decision. Id. at 104.
In Cameron, the majority failed to give proper effect to the language contained in MCL 500.3145(1). 1  As I noted in my Cameron dissent, the "one-year-back rule" is not a period of limitations as interpreted by the majority. Id. at 106. Rather, the "one-year-back rule" is part of the statute that details how to apply the tolling provision contained in the period of limitations laid out in the first sentence of MCL 500.3145(1). Id. at 106-107. By holding that the one-year-back rule was a period of  [*310]  limitations, the Cameron majority failed  [**908]  to "give meaning to the actual text of the statute." Id. at 108.
In addition to the lack of restraint of the Cameron majority's use of the judicial power of interpretation, Chief Justice KELLY's majority opinion in this case shows that the Cameron majority failed to exercise common sense and fairness. As noted in Chief Justice KELLY's majority opinion in this case, Cameron resulted in the Legislature's savings provisions regarding minors and government entities becoming hollow rights when injuries occurred more than a year before a lawsuit was filed.
On the subject of stare decisis, Justice YOUNG's dissent in this case attempts to deceive the public. It attempts to lump together the four justices who agree with parts of the majority opinion into having had some sort of previously stated fidelity to stare decisis that those justices have abandoned since former Chief Justice TAYLOR's overwhelming defeat in the 2008 election.
Justice YOUNG's dissent quotes  [***29] various past statements, made by those justices signing portions of the majority opinion, regarding stare decisis and criticizing the former "majority of four" (former Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and MARKMAN). With respect to myself, the dissent quotes a statement I made in response to the improper and unfair dismantling of decades of longstanding insurance contract law by the former "majority of four" in Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 473 Mich 562, 702 NW2d 539 (2005). In Devillers, I stated, "Correction for correction's sake does not make sense. The case has not been made why the Court should not adhere to the doctrine of stare decisis in this case." Id. at 622 (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).
 [*311]  Justice YOUNG's dissent uses my Devillers statement in what appears to be an attempt to try to get people to believe that I have somehow changed my view of stare decisis since former Chief Justice TAYLOR was defeated. The dissent's misleading assertions are simply incorrect.
My Devillers statement itself shows that I was criticizing the disregard for stare decisis in that specific case. My Devillers statement is an example of my service to the rule of law and  [***30] a partial expression of my view of the policy of stare decisis, which is that past precedent should generally be followed but that, in deciding whether wrongly decided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its facts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness.
Justice YOUNG's dissent cannot point to a statement where I professed some sort of position regarding stare decisis as an immutable doctrine because I have not taken that position and therefore have made no such statements. Justice YOUNG's various dissents continue to mischaracterize my positions by making inaccurate statements, using partial quotes taken out of context, and omitting relevant information in an apparent attempt to deceive readers. 2  
I agree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief Justice Roberts of the United States Supreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in Citizens United v Fed Election Comm, 558 U.S.    ,    , 130 S Ct 876, 920, 175 L Ed 2d 753, 806 (2010), when  [***31] he said that
 [*312]  stare decisis is neither an "inexorable command," Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 577 [123 S Ct 2472, 156 L Ed 2d 508] (2003), nor "a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision," Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119 [60  [**909]  S Ct 444, 84 L Ed 604, 1940-1 C.B. 223] (1940) . . . . If it were, segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 [16 S Ct 1138, 41 L Ed 256] (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 [74 S Ct 686, 98 L Ed 873] (1954); Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., 261 U.S. 525 [43 S Ct 394, 67 L Ed 785] (1923), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 [57 S Ct 578, 81 L Ed 703] (1937); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 [48 S Ct 564, 72 L Ed 944] (1928), overruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 [88 S Ct 507, 19 L Ed 2d 576] (1967).
Chief Justice Roberts further called stare decisis a "principle of policy" and said that it "is not an end in itself." Id. at    , 130 S Ct at 920, 175 L Ed 2d at 807. He explained that "[i]ts greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional  [***32] ideal-the rule of law. It follows that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent."

 [*313]  I agree with Chief Justice Roberts that stare decisis is a policy and not an immutable doctrine. I chose not to sign Chief Justice KELLY's lead opinion in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 316-320, 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to create a standardized test for stare decisis. Likewise, I do not sign the majority opinion's stare decisis section in this case because it applies Petersen. There is no need for this Court to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis. In fact, it is an impossible task. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule precedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case  [***34] basis. 4  
 [*314]  [**910]   In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly decided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and exercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness-justice for all.
In serving the rule of law and applying judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness to the case at hand, I agree with and join the majority opinion's holding that Cameron is overruled.
Elizabeth A. Weaver
HATHAWAY, J. (concurring).
I fully concur with Chief Justice KELLY's analysis and conclusion in this matter and support overruling Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 476 Mich 55, 718 NW2d 784 (2006). I also fully concur with Justice WEAVER's stare decisis analysis  [***36] in her concurring opinion. I write separately to express my own thoughts on the doctrine of stare decisis.
Given the debate amongst the justices of this Court concerning what constitutes the proper stare decisis analysis, I find it insightful to review how our United States Supreme Court has treated the doctrine. Stare decisis is a principle of policy that commands judicial respect for a court's earlier decisions and the rules of law that they embody. See Harris v United States, 536 U.S. 545, 556-557, 122 S Ct 2406, 153 L Ed 2d 524 (2002); Helvering v Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119, 60 S Ct 444, 84 L Ed 604; 1940-1 C.B. 223 (1940). "Stare decisis is the preferred  [*315]  course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process." Payne v Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S Ct 2597, 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). However, when balancing the need to depart from precedent with the need to adhere to established precedent, it is important to bear in mind that stare decisis is neither an "inexorable command," Lawrence v Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 577, 123 S Ct 2472, 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003),  [***37] nor "a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision," Helvering, 309 US at 119. "If it were, segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 [16 S Ct 1138, 41 L Ed 256] (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 [74 S Ct 686, 98 L Ed 873] (1954); Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., 261 U.S. 525 [43 S Ct 394, 67 L Ed 785] (1923), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co.. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 [57 S. Ct. 578, 81 L. Ed. 703] (1937); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 [48 S Ct 564, 72 L Ed 944] (1928), overruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 [88 S Ct 507, 19 L Ed 2d 576] (1967)." Citizens United v Fed Election Comm, 558 U.S.    ,    , 130 S. Ct. 876, 920, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753, 806 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring).
 [**911]  I too believe that stare decisis is a principle of policy. As stated in Helvering:
We recognize that stare decisis embodies an important social policy. It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations. But stare decisis is  [***38] a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence  [*316]  involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience. 1 
I do not agree with any approach to stare decisis that suggests or implies that it is a "rule" or "law" subject to a particularized test to be used in all circumstances. Any particular approach to stare decisis, such as the one taken in Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439, 613 NW2d 307 (2000), is not "law" or "established precedent" that would require us to overrule, reject or modify its analysis. The Robinson approach to stare decisis, just as the one taken in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 773 NW2d 564 (2009), is one among many varying approaches, and no particular approach, in and of itself, is inherently superior to another. As with any policy determination, the approach taken in any given case will depend on the facts and circumstances presented.
Historically, the United States Supreme Court has utilized many different approaches to stare decisis, including such approaches as those involving  [***39] a "compelling justification," 2  "special justification," 3  and a determination that a case was "wrongly decided." 4  Each of these approaches is valid and offers a different nuance to stare decisis consideration. 5  However, because stare decisis is a policy consideration, which must be considered on a case-by-case basis, the particular  [*317]  analytical approach will differ from case to case. Most importantly, the critical analysis should be on the rationale regarding whether or not to change precedent.
It is also worthy to note that not only has the United States Supreme Court historically not taken one single approach to the application of stare decisis, the Court has not felt compelled to discuss stare decisis in all cases when precedent is  [***40] being overturned. Many landmark cases that overruled well-established precedent did not discuss or even mention the phrase "stare decisis." For example, Brown overruled Plessy, thereby ending segregation in our public schools, without mentioning the phrase "stare decisis," much less articulating and following a particularized test. Similarly, Gideon v Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S Ct 792, 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), which established the rights of indigents to have counsel in all criminal cases, not merely capital offenses, overruled Betts v Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S Ct 1252, 86 L Ed 1595 (1942), again without mentioning "stare decisis" or a particularized test. Instead, both of these cases focused on the important policy considerations that weighed in favor of overruling precedent. 6  
 [**912]  With these principles in mind, any analysis of the impact of stare decisis must focus on the individual case and the reason for overruling precedent. Thus, the reasons for overruling Cameron are paramount to any articulated test and the special and compelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case. As I  [*318]  agree with the well-articulated reasons expressed by Chief Justice KELLY, I will not repeat them here.
Diane M. Hathaway
KELLY, C.J. (concurring).
I authored the majority opinion in this case and therefore join it in its entirety. I write separately because Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN continue to misleadingly refer to a statement I made off the bench nearly two years ago that was published by the Detroit Free Press. 1  They seem to believe that this statement provides them insight into my motivation for voting as I have in every subsequent case that has come before the Court. They are manifestly incorrect. To be clear, my remark reflected my desire to "undo . . . the damage" done to the good reputation of this Court as an institution during the former majority's tenure. 2  My only "agenda" was and is to restore nationwide respect  [***42] to this Court and to chart a new course of civility. 3  Of course, I do not control Justice YOUNG's pen. His dissenting  [*319]  opinion demonstrates that my efforts in the area of civility have not yet been as successful as I hoped.
Written opinions serve an important function in the judicial process: they provide a forum in which the  [***44] majority and dissenting justices debate the legal issues raised in cases. Sometimes that debate  [**913]  focuses on a narrow question. Other times, the debate extends to broader legal questions with wider implications, such as the doctrine of stare decisis, a particularly controversial matter.
It is no secret that the philosophical divisions among the justices on this Court are deep. For some years now, our disagreements on legal questions have erupted in occasionally heated and unpleasant personal recriminations. This case is a perfect example. 4  
I know that, if asked, both Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN would agree with my sentiments and would deplore these outbursts. Both justices fully understand  [*320]  that personal recriminations reduce the public's confidence in the objectivity and wisdom of judges and in the Court as an institution.
With  [***45] these reflections in mind, I urge them to reevaluate the utility of their ad hominem attacks and eliminate them. Surely each has significant confidence in the strength of their legal arguments to allow those arguments to stand on their merits, absent distracting attack props. Moreover, their personal assaults do nothing to resolve the legal issues before us; they do not benefit the parties to a case or the citizens of Michigan whom we serve.
I sincerely regret having to address these matters in the first place and would prefer that this opinion were not necessary. But I cannot stand passively by and allow Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN to accuse me and the justices in the "new majority" of being unprincipled and driven by inappropriate motives. Their attacks wrongly accuse Justices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, HATHAWAY, and me of reaching predetermined outcomes in many, if not all, cases rather than following the law, as we are sworn to do.
People respect the judiciary only insofar as they believe that judges decide cases impartially and without ulterior motives. Justices YOUNG's and CORRIGAN's assertion in this and previous cases that we have an "agenda" that involves selecting and overturning certain  [***46] precedents is unfair and untrue. Furthermore, it undermines respect both for the justices attacked and for those making the unwarranted accusations. Most importantly, it reduces public confidence in the judiciary as a whole.

Dissent




YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
Evidently, the governing standard is to be what might be called the unfettered wisdom of a majority of this Court,  [*321]  revealed to an obedient people on a case-by-case basis. This is not only not the government of laws that the Constitution established; it is not a government of laws at all.
--Antonin Scalia, in Morrison v Olson 1  
I agree entirely with Justice MARKMAN's dissenting opinion in this case. I write separately only to note that, today, the decade-long shrill pretense of several of my colleagues' adherence to "preserving precedent" is over. The concurring opinions of Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY make clear that there is no longer any need for them to pretend that "precedent" is anything sacred for the "new majority" of this Court. 2  That mask has now been cast aside. After a decade of dissents in  [**914]  which  [***47] Justices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, and KELLY played the recurrent theme that they were hawk-like adherents to stare decisis, 3  attacking the then majority--Justices TAYLOR, CORRIGAN, MARKMAN, and me--for failing to preserve cases with whose results  [*322]  they agreed, 4  today precedent is no longer an "issue." Nor is precedent now an issue for my newest colleague, Justice HATHAWAY, although her campaigns for election to the Court of Appeals and this Court featured prominently her position adamantly proclaiming an absolutist support for stare decisis. 5  
The new majority, being a majority, is now free to do as it pleases. And it pleases the new majority to honor the agenda to which our new Chief Justice pledged them after the defeat of Chief Justice TAYLOR in 2008:
 [*323]  We the new majority [Chief Justice KELLY and Justices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, and HATHAWAY] will get the ship off the shoals and back on course, and we will  [**915]  undo a great deal of the damage that the Republican-dominated court has done. Not only will we not neglect our duties, we will not sleep on the bench. 6 
The new majority has not been shy about acting on its agenda to "undo" the precedents of the "Republican-dominated court." In the  [***51] 18 months of its existence, the new majority has moved muscularly in making good on this promise. Just in this term alone, the new majority has overturned the following cases recently decided by this Court:
1. In People v Feezel, 486 Mich 184, 783 NW2d 67 (2010), the new majority overruled People v Derror, 475 Mich 316, 715 NW2d 822 (2006).
2. In McCormick v Carrier, 487 Mich 180,     NW2d    , 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1654 (2010), the new majority overruled Kreiner v Fischer, 471 Mich 109, 683 NW2d 611 (2004).
In Lansing Sch Ed Ass'n v Lansing Bd of Ed, 487 Mich 349,     NW2d    , 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1657 (2010), the new majority overruled (at least) the following cases:
3. Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm'rs, 464 Mich 726, 629 NW2d 900 (2001);
4. Crawford v Dep't of Civil Service, 466 Mich 250, 645 NW2d 6 (2002);
5. Nat'l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, 471 Mich 608, 684 NW2d 800 (2004);
6. Associated Builders & Contractors v Dep't of Consumer & Indus Servs Dir, 472 Mich. 117, 693 N.W.2d 374 (2005);
7. Mich Chiropractic Council v Comm'r of the Office of Fin & Ins Servs, 475 Mich 363, 716 NW2d 561 (2006);
 [*324]  8. Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Sch, 479 Mich 336, 737 NW2d 158 (2007);
9. Mich Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestle Waters North America Inc, 479 Mich 280, 737 NW2d 447 (2007);  [***52] and
10. Manuel v Gill, 481 Mich 637, 753 NW2d 48 (2008).
11. In Bezeau v Palace Sports & Entertainment, Inc, 487 Mich 455,     NW2d    , 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1656 (2010), the new majority expressly overruled the limited retroactive effect of Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co, 478 Mich 28, 732 NW2d 56 (2007).
12. And in this case, the new majority now overrules Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 476 Mich 55, 718 NW2d 784 (2006).
And this list is separate and distinct from those cases in which the new majority has ignored or otherwise failed to follow other recently decided precedents of this Court, 7  or  [*325]  the case that the new majority implicitly overruled by enacting a contradictory  [**916]  court rule. 8  Several justices have even gone so far as to call into question the continued validity of precedents that are in no relevant way before the Court. 9  Indeed, by expressly overruling cases this term when, last term, it simply ignored or implicitly overruled them, the new majority has become more aggressive in achieving its policy agenda.
It is a touch more than ironic that Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY now argue that well-established principles of stare decisis must give way to a justice's subjective view of a case. This process produces a result whereby the parties and the public will never know what criteria or standards several justices on this Court will employ until after the decision has been made. This ad hoc, subjective process is the very antithesis of the "rule of law" and instead denotes a system hijacked by the concurring justices, who appear to be guided and constrained  [***55] only by their personal beliefs. That stare decisis is a "principle of policy," as Justice HATHAWAY repeats many times, does not mean that analysis of a case pursuant to the doctrine should be driven by each judge's personal policy choices. 10  Nor does the fact that  [*326]  stare decisis is a "principle of policy" mean that judges need not announce a fixed set of principles that will guide their decisions. 11  Yet this is  [**917]  precisely what characterizes  [*327]  Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY's unique brand of feckless jurisprudence announced today.
The rule of law, by definition, requires judges to decide cases on the basis of principles, announced in advance, rather than on a personal or subjective preference for or against a party before them. This ensures stability in the law despite the diversity of judges' personal beliefs. Whether we, as judges, "like" the outcome is, quite simply, irrelevant to whether it reflects a correct conclusion of law. It is harrowing that Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY either do not understand this concept or refuse to subscribe to it, preferring to base their decisions on subjective "policy consideration[s]."
Finally, Chief Justice KELLY has tried on several occasions to explain away what she meant when she said the "new majority" would "undo . . . the damage [of] the Republican-dominated court," as she again attempts today. Chief Justice KELLY finds it disquieting that I quote her remarks about the "new majority's" agenda. She should. Her remarks are as disquieting as they are scurrilous. What is noteworthy is that Chief Justice KELLY has never repudiated what she said, apologized for  [***59] it, or sufficiently explained why that statement doesn't mean what it plainly says. Instead, she merely prefers that I not repeat it for reasons that are obvious to all. Rare is it that a judge publicly tells the public that she has an agenda and what it is. I am glad that the Chief Justice was so candid because everyone can examine her conduct in light of her statement. Her motivations for making this dreadful remark and whether her subsequent resolution of cases is consistent with her remark are questions for the public to decide.
 [*328]  Moreover, after being the target of much uncivil criticism by then Justice KELLY over the years, I am nonplussed by the Chief Justice's pique at the passion of my dissent and the tone in which I have expressed it. One need only review the Chief Justice's dissenting opinions over the years to acknowledge that her views on civility have conveniently changed as quickly as the new majority's view regarding the importance of preserving precedent. 12  Now that she is part of this  [**918]  Court's  [*329]  philosophical majority, her criticism of my impassioned tone recalls a line from Shakespeare: "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." 13  
Moreover, the Chief Justice's calls for civility are especially hypocritical given the very ugly reference she made to the false "sleeping judge" ads that played so prominent a role in the campaign to defeat Chief Justice TAYLOR in 2008. Given the context that this remark was made just after the defeat of Chief Justice TAYLOR in the last election, Chief Justice KELLY's final comment that "we will not sleep  [***63] on the bench" was a particularly uncivil reference denigrating our distinguished former colleague. 14  Chief Justice KELLY was present during the arguments of the case in which it was falsely asserted that Chief Justice TAYLOR fell asleep, and she knew, or should have known, that the claim was false. These facts are impossible to square with her current desire to improve civility among members of the Court.
 [*330]  The public should be just as indignant as I am--not only regarding the hypocrisy of the new majority's radically changing views on the question of preserving precedents, but also with its equally radically subjective approach to the law. I will continue to strive to bring such issues to the public's attention. The public may judge whether the former majority or this new majority's opinions provided greater predictability in the  [***64] law and were more faithful to the actual language of the statutes, or whether the legislative "work product" was disregarded for the pet policies  [**919]  of the several justices who formed these respective majorities. Indeed, in a constitutional republic where judges are elected, it is the obligation of the public to do just that. Otherwise, for the foreseeable future, the public can look forward to more "damage control" in the form of brash judicial activism from the new majority.
CORRIGAN, J., concurred with YOUNG, J.
MARKMAN, J. (dissenting).
I dissent from the instant decision overruling Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 476 Mich 55, 718 NW2d 784 (2006), which held that the no-fault automobile insurance act's one-year-back rule, MCL 500.3145(1), is a damages-limiting provision, not a statute of limitations, and Liptow v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 272 Mich App 544, 726 NW2d 442 (2006), which held that MCL 600.5821(4) does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule. 1  
 [*331]  MCL 500.3145(1), part of the no-fault automobile insurance act, provides, in pertinent part: "[T]he claimant may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced." 2  (Emphasis added.) This is known as the one-year-back rule. MCL 600.5821(4), part of the Revised Judicature Act (RJA), provides, in pertinent part:
Actions brought in the name of . . . any political subdivision of the state of Michigan 3  . . . for the recovery of the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in hospitals . . . are not subject to the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding. [Emphasis added.]
In Cameron, this Court held that the minority/insanity  [***67] tolling provision of the RJA, MCL 600.5851(1), which  [*332]  addresses when one may "bring [an] action," 4  does not preclude the application of the no-fault  [**920]  automobile insurance act's one-year-back rule because the latter only limits the amount of benefits that can be recovered, i.e., the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision rather than a statute of limitations. See also Howard v Gen Motors Corp, 427 Mich 358, 385-386, 399 NW2d 10 (1986) (lead opinion by BRICKLEY, J.) (explaining that the one- and two-year-back rules of the Worker's Disability Compensation Act are not statutes of limitations). 5  I continue to believe that Cameron was correctly decided.
 [*333]  The one-year-back rule "limits the amount of personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits recoverable to those incurred within one year before the action was commenced." Cameron, 476 Mich at 58 n 1. As Cameron explained:
By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a minor or person suffering from insanity may "make the entry or bring the action." It does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). [Id. at 62.]
That is, the one-year-back rule by its straightforward language serves only as a limitation on the recovery of benefits; it does not define a period within which a claimant may file a cause of action. Therefore, the one-year-back rule is not a statute of  [***70] limitations, and it lies outside the scope of what is affected by the RJA's minority/insanity tolling provision.
The tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1) tolls the limitation that applies to the "bring[ing of an] action"; however, it does not toll the limitation that applies to the "recover[y of] benefits," in particular the limitation set forth in MCL 500.3145(1). Accordingly, although a plaintiff  [*334]  may not be prohibited from "bring[ing] the action," a plaintiff is prohibited from "recover[ing] benefits for any portion of the loss incurred  [**921]  more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced." [Id. at 77 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]
The majority apparently believes that it is appropriate to overrule Cameron because Cameron overruled Geiger v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, 114 Mich App 283, 318 NW2d 833 (1982). 6  First, Geiger was a Court of Appeals decision, and thus not binding upon this Court. 7  [*335]  Catalina Mktg Sales Corp v Dep't of Treasury, 470 Mich 13, 23, 678 NW2d 619 (2004). Second, as Cameron itself explained:
In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeals [in Geiger], looking behind the language of the statute and focusing on its understanding of the Legislature's purported  [***71] intent, determined that the legislative purpose behind the minority/insanity tolling provision for periods of limitations was to preserve not only a person's cause of action during the period of disability but also the person's damage claims. It opined that to not read the statute in this fashion would "severely limit the utility" of the minority/insanity tolling provision. The Court then concluded that, "[i]n order to advance the policy of RJA § 5851," the minority/insanity tolling provision applies to prevent the capping of damages under the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1).
 [**922]  We believe this ruling was erroneous for the most uncomplicated reason; namely, that we must assume that the thing the Legislature wants is best understood by reading what it said. Because what was said in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) is clear, no less clear is the policy. Damages are only allowed for one year back from the date the lawsuit is filed. We are enforcing the statutes as written. While some may question the wisdom of the Legislature's capping damages in this fashion, it is unquestionably a power that the Legislature has under our  [*336]  Constitution. Thus, because Geiger's conclusion that the  [***72] minority/insanity tolling provision applies to extend the one-year-back rule is contrary to what the Legislature clearly directed in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1), Geiger is overruled. [Cameron, 476 Mich at 63-64.]
The majority here commits the same error that Geiger committed. That is, the majority believes that it can somehow discern the purpose of the statute from something other than its actual language, despite the fact that this Court has repeatedly held that this constitutes an improper approach to statutory interpretation. As I explained in my concurring opinion in  [***75] Cameron:
In Geiger v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exch, 114 Mich App 283, 318 NW2d 833 (1982), the Court of Appeals held that the minority/insanity tolling provision does toll the one-year-back rule of the no-fault automobile insurance act. However, the only reason it gave for reaching such a conclusion is that "[a] contrary rule would severely limit the utility of the minority saving provision . . . ." Id. at 291. I do not necessarily disagree with Geiger that not tolling the one-year-back rule may well "limit the utility" of the tolling provision, perhaps even "severely," but that is often what happens when there are statutes that are in tension with one another. It can be argued just as easily that to do the opposite, to toll the one-year-back rule, would be to "severely limit the utility" of the one-year-back rule. Indeed, it can be argued that to toll the one-year-back rule is not merely to "severely limit its utility," but to do it even greater damage by vitiating its language altogether. 8  In the end, the Geiger rationale is not even a legal rationale at all; rather, it is little more than a statement by the majority  [*337]  in Geiger that it preferred a different statute than the one  [***76] actually enacted by the Legislature. [Id. at 83-84 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]
The majority criticizes Cameron on the basis that "[t]he only authority cited for [its] interpretation was in Justice MARKMAN's concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from Justice BRICKLEY's lead opinion in Howard v Gen Motors Corp." This statement very much illustrates the flaw in the majority's approach to statutory construction-- it fails to recognize that the best indicator of the Legislature's intent is the language of the statute itself. That is, the best "authority" cited in either the majority or concurring opinions in Cameron for their interpretation is the actual language of the statutes at issue. That the majority fails to apprehend this first principle of statutory interpretation sufficiently speaks to the shortcomings in its analysis.
 [**923]  Finally, with regard to the majority's apparent  [***77] belief that it is somehow appropriate to overrule Cameron because Cameron overruled Geiger, even if Geiger was controlling precedent-- which it is not-- the majority errs by conflating all precedents as deserving of equal respect. However, as I explained in my concurring opinion in Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197, 226, 731 NW2d 41 (2007), "not all precedents are built alike . . . ." Indeed, "some are better reasoned than others, . . . some are grounded in the exercise of discretionary judgments and others in the interpretation of plain language, [and] some are thorough in their analyses and others superficial." Id. As discussed earlier, while Cameron entailed a serious effort to interpret the language of the law and to render our case-law consistent with this language, Geiger, as also explained earlier, was principally grounded in a desire to advance the policy of the minority/insanity tolling provision over  [*338]  the policy of the one-year-back rule of the no-fault act. For these reasons, Cameron's overruling of Geiger can hardly be equated with the majority's overruling of Cameron. The former entailed an effort to render the caselaw of our state more consistent with the intentions  [***78] of the Legislature, while the latter renders it less consistent. The majority has never quite grasped that the issue of stare decisis is one that cannot be viewed exclusively in quantitative terms, but must also be viewed in qualitative terms. By indiscriminately placing on equal footing all decisions of this Court that overrule precedent, without considering whether each does so in order to further the intentions of the lawmaker or to further the intentions of the judge, the majority communicates well the flaws in its understandings of stare decisis and of the judicial role itself.
In Liptow, the Court of Appeals, relying on this Court's decision in Cameron, held that MCL 600.5821(4) does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule because MCL 600.5821(4) only exempts the state and its political subdivisions from a statute of limitations and the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision, not a statute of limitations. This Court denied leave to appeal in Liptow, 478 Mich 853, 731 N.W.2d 84 (2007), and I agree with the Court of Appeals' decision. As the Court of Appeals explained in Liptow:
MCL 600.5821(4) provides that actions brought by the state or its subdivisions to recover  [***79] the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in state institutions "are not subject to the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding." We conclude that, by the plain import of this language, the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be  [*339]  brought at any time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any other limiting provisions. In other words, like the minority tolling provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the time during which the state may bring an action; it "does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has been brought." Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 62. Accordingly, we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 61-62. [Liptow, 272 Mich App at 555-556 (emphasis in the original).]
While the RJA, specifically MCL 600.5821(4), states that an action by the state or one  [***80] of its political subdivisions "may be brought at any time without limitation,"  [**924]  the no-fault act, specifically MCL 500.3145(1), states that the claimant "may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced." (Emphasis added.) Having the right to bring a cause of action is not the equivalent of having the right to recover an unlimited amount of damages. 9  Therefore, when these two provisions are read together, it is clear that while a political subdivision may bring an action at any time, it cannot recover benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced. In other words, MCL 600.5821(4), which pertains only to when an action may be commenced, does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule, which only limits how much can be recovered after the action has been commenced.
The majority overrules Liptow simply because it relied on Cameron. Because I believe that Cameron was correctly decided and that Liptow appropriately relied  [*340]   [***81] on Cameron, I would not overrule either Cameron or Liptow. As is obvious from the flood of opinions that the majority has recently overruled, the majority justices' repeated self-proclamations of adherence to stare decisis were merely a reflection of the fact that they agreed with the particular decisions that were being overruled. For a more thorough discussion of the majority justices' past expressions of fealty toward stare decisis, see my dissent in McCormick v Carrier, 487 Mich 180, 262-279,     NW2d    , 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1654, *144 (2010). However, the lead opinion's reliance on Chief Justice KELLY's opinion in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 773 NW2d 564 (2009), which only Justice CAVANAGH joined, rather than the majority opinion in Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439, 613 NW2d 307 (2000), should not go unnoticed. For a thorough discussion of Chief Justice KELLY's Petersen standard for overruling precedent, see my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 350. 10  
 [*341]   [**925]  What also cannot go without comment is the lead opinion's conclusion that "upholding Cameron is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests" and, thus, that "this [Petersen] factor weighs heavily in favor of abrogating Cameron." Given that the lead justices believe that it is appropriate to consider their own conceptions of "public interests," their relative silence is telling with regard to the "public interest" in the viability of our state's no-fault system. It has been repeatedly recognized that because of the mandatory nature of no-fault insurance, the Legislature intended that it be affordable. 11  The lead opinion gives  [*342]  little heed to the fact that its decision will once again raise the premiums of all insured drivers in this state. 12  
The majority also asserts that because "MCL 600.5821(4) lists the costs [for which recovery may be sought] as those for the 'maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in hospitals, homes, schools, and other state institutions,'" it "supersedes all limitations in MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-back rule's limitation on the period of recovery." In other words, the majority contends that MCL 600.5821(4) provides an absolute right to recover the enumerated costs. The problem with this argument, however, is that the statute says no such thing. The statute does not say that there is an unfettered right to recover the enumerated costs. Instead, MCL 600.5821(4) says only that "[a]ctions brought . . . for the recovery of the [enumerated]  [*343]  cost[s]. . . are not subject to the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without  [***87] limitation, the  [**926]  provisions of any statute notwithstanding." That is, the reference to "the recovery of the cost[s]" is in the context of describing what types of actions are not subject to the statute of limitations-- those "[a]ctions brought . . . for the recovery of the [enumerated] cost[s]. . . ." Nowhere within the statute is there any indication that the Legislature intended to preclude any and all limitations on the amounts of money the state and its political subdivisions can recover. Instead, because MCL 600.5821(4) only pertains to when an action may be brought, it "is irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1)." Cameron, 476 Mich at 62.
Plaintiffs also argue that Liptow was inconsistent with Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm Mut Ins Co, 250 Mich. App. 719, 650 N.W.2d 129 (2002), in which the Court of Appeals held that MCL 600.5821(4) in the RJA, exempts the state and its political subdivisions from the no-fault act's statute of limitations in MCL 500.3145(1). Specifically, the Court held:
The language of the statute clearly indicates that the Legislature intended to exempt the state and its political subdivisions from all statutes of limitation.  [***88] Thus, [MCL 600.5821(4)] exempts plaintiff from the statute of limitations contained in [MCL 500.3145(1)]. [Id. at 733 (emphasis added).]
However, as the Court of Appeals explained in Univ of Mich Regents v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 12, 2009 (Docket No. 281917):
[T]he decision in Univ of Michigan Regents concerned "statutes of limitation," not "the damages-limiting portion of MCL 500.3145(1), the  [*344]  one-year back rule." Consequently, there is no conflict between Univ of Michigan Regents and Liptow. 13 
As this Court has explained, "MCL 500.3145(1) contains two limitations on the time for commencing an action and one limitation on the period for which benefits may be recovered[.]" Cameron, 476 Mich at 61, citing Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 473 Mich 562, 574, 702 NW2d 539 (2005). First, "an action for PIP benefits must be commenced within a year of the accident unless the insured gives written notice of injury or previously received PIP benefits from the insurer." Cameron, 476 Mich at 61. Second, "[i]f notice was given or payment was made, the action can be commenced within one year of the most recent loss." Id. Third, under  [***89] the one-year-back rule, "[r]ecovery . . . is limited to losses incurred during the year before the filing of the action." Id. Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm concerned the statute of limitations portion of MCL 500.3145(1), not the one-year-back rule. Therefore, there is utterly no inconsistency between Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm and Liptow. 14  
The Court of Appeals dissent stated, "I believe that the holding in Liptow takes an irrationally and improperly narrow view of this statute by holding that it exempts entities like plaintiff[s] from a one-year limitation on bringing an action but not from a one-year limitation on recovering in such an action." Univ of Mich Regents v  [**927]  Titan Ins Co, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued June 5, 2008  [*345]  (Docket No. 276710) (DAVIS, P.J., dissenting) (emphasis in  [***90] the original). 15  Cameron involved a very similar situation. In my concurring opinion in Cameron, I indicated that I was concerned because
although the tolling provision instructs minors and insane persons that they are entitled to wait until one year after their legal disabilities have been removed to bring their civil actions, if they do wait, they will only be allowed to recover what may be a portion of the total damages incurred. [Cameron, 476 Mich at 73 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]
However, I concluded that, regardless of my concerns about the wisdom (or lack thereof) of the statute, a judge is bound to follow this language. The same remains true here. Although to some it may seem less than optimal to exempt entities such as plaintiffs from  [*346]  a one-year limitation on bringing an action, but not also from a one-year limitation on recovery in that an action, that is clearly what the Legislature has done, and it is entitled to act in a way that is viewed with disapproval by members of the judiciary.
Nor is this, assuming arguendo that such is a relevant consideration, an "absurd result." Even to the extent that an "absurd result" doctrine exists in Michigan, 16  a resultis only "absurd" if it is "'quite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended the result . . . .'" Id. at 85 n 9 (MARKMAN, J., concurring), quoting Public Citizen v United States Dep't of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 470-471, 109 S Ct 2558, 105 L Ed 2d 377 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring). It is entirely possible that the Legislature could have intended the result reached in Liptow. For example, the Legislature "might have intended these results in order to make no-fault insurance more affordable." Cameron, 476 Mich at 80 (MARKMAN, J., concurring) (emphasis in the  [**928]  original), citing Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 472 Mich 521, 539, 697 NW2d 895 (2005) (stating that this Court has always been cognizant of the potential problem of "cost containment for this mandatory coverage" when interpreting  [***93] the no-fault act), citing Shavers v Attorney General, 402 Mich 554, 599, 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (holding that "[i]n choosing to make no-fault insurance compulsory for all motorists, the Legislature has made the registration and operation of a motor vehicle inexorably dependent  [*347]  on whether no-fault insurance is available at fair and equitable rates"). Conceivably, as well,
a reasonable lawmaker might have intended to maintain the solvency of insurers, and to enhance their ability to undertake future planning, by protecting them from multimillion dollar lawsuits filed many years after medical expenses have been incurred, and only after relatively manageable month-to-month expenses have been allowed to develop into more extraordinary decade-to-decade expenses. [Cameron, 476 Mich at 81-82 (MARKMAN, J., concurring) (emphasis in the original).]
That is,
[s]uch a lawmaker might have sought to obligate those who have incurred medical expenses to seek reimbursement on a relatively ongoing basis, rather than allowing them to wait for many years before seeking compensation. Indeed, it is conceivable that a reasonable lawmaker might have wished to incentivize earlier, rather than later, causes of action  [***94] in order to encourage those who have incurred medical expenses to act in a manner consistent with their own financial self-interest, and to ensure that their medical expenses were reimbursed expeditiously. [Id. at 82 (emphasis in the original).]
"Finally, a reasonable lawmaker might have concluded that practical problems pertaining to evidence and proofs in old claims required some balance between the interests of the [claimant] and those of the insurer." Id. (emphasis in the original).
As the majority acknowledges, "if the one-year-back rule applies to [plaintiffs'] claim, plaintiffs are entitled to no damages," because all of their  [***95] losses were "incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced," MCL 500.3145(1). Indeed, all of plaintiffs' losses were incurred in 2000, and yet plaintiffs waited until 2006 to file this cause of action. Because I believe, for the reasons set forth above, that  [*348]  the one-year-back rule does apply to plaintiffs' claim, I conclude that plaintiffs' damages are not recoverable. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.
