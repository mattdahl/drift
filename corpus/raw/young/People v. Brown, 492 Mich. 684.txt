Opinion




 [**210]   [*686]  BEFORE THE ENTIRE BENCH
Marilyn Kelly, J.
This criminal law case involves a defendant who was not informed of the maximum sentence that could be imposed on him before he pleaded guilty. MCR 6.302(B)(2) requires that the court notify a defendant of the maximum possible prison sentence. Defendant pleaded guilty of second-degree home invasion as a second-offense habitual offender, but the trial court never advised him of his maximum possible sentence as an habitual offender. We ordered oral argument on defendant's application for leave to appeal to determine if the  [*687]  court rule requires such notice.1  We also asked the parties to address what relief, if any, is available to a defendant under the circumstances of this case.2 
We hold that MCR 6.302(B)(2) requires the trial court to apprise a defendant of his or her maximum possible prison sentence as an habitual offender before accepting a guilty plea. Because defendant in this case  [***2] was not so apprised, his guilty plea was defective. We also hold that MCR 6.310(C) provides the sole remedy available to a defendant in these circumstances. Hence, pursuant to MCR 6.310(C), defendant may allow his plea and sentence to stand or withdraw his plea, in which case the court shall vacate his conviction and sentence. In the latter event, the matter may proceed to trial. Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Defendant conspired with his girlfriend to rob her employer's home. He stole $10,300 worth of coins, currency, and guns from the unlocked home and shared the proceeds with her. He was apprehended and charged with second-degree home invasion,3  larceny of a firearm,4  being a felon in possession of a firearm,5  and larceny in a building6  as a fourth-offense habitual offender.7 
Defendant pleaded guilty as a second-offense habitual offender8  to second-degree home invasion in  [*688]  exchange for dismissal of the other charges. At his plea hearing, the trial judge explained the maximum sentence, advising him that second-degree home invasion  [***3] "is a felony; it is  [**211]  punishable by up to 15 years in the state prison. Do you understand?" Defendant confirmed that he understood. The judge sentenced him to a prison term of 6 years and 3 months to 22 years and 6 months and ordered him to pay restitution.9  He did not object to the maximum sentence.
Defendant later moved to withdraw his plea or for resentencing. He argued that he should be resentenced without the habitual-offender enhancement because the trial judge had failed to advise him of the enhanced maximum sentence before taking the guilty plea. The judge denied the motion, relying on People v Boatman10  and declining to decide whether various orders of this Court11  had impliedly overruled Boatman.
The Court of Appeals denied defendant's application for leave to appeal in a split decision; Judge Gleicher would have granted the application. Defendant applied for leave to appeal in this Court, and we ordered and heard oral argument  [***4] on whether to grant the application or take other action.12 
STANDARD OF REVIEW AND LEGAL BACKGROUND
This Court reviews for an abuse of discretion a trial court's ruling on a motion to withdraw a plea.13  A defendant pleading guilty must enter an understanding,  [*689]  voluntary, and accurate plea.14  MCR 6.302(B)(2) states that for a plea to be understanding, the defendant must be informed of "the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense and any mandatory minimum sentence required by law[.]"
The habitual-offender statutes, MCL 769.10 et seq., provide enhancement of a defendant's sentence on the basis of prior felony convictions. They do not create a substantive offense independent of the principal charge. "Rather, it is a sentence-enhancement procedure with a deterrent and punitive purpose."15  Under MCL 769.13(3), the prosecution is permitted to file notice of an habitual-offender enhancement after a defendant pleads guilty.16 
This Court has never determined whether, in order to comply with MCR 6.302(B)(2),  [**212]  a trial court must to inform a defendant of the maximum possible enhanced sentence before taking a guilty plea. The question was  [*690]  presented six years ago in People v Boatman.17  In that case, the defendant pleaded guilty of resisting  [***6] and obstructing a police officer as a fourth-offense habitual offender. The plea agreement required him to be sentenced within the sentencing guidelines.
The trial court informed Mr. Boatman that his maximum sentence would be two years' incarceration, the correct sentence for an unenhanced charge of resisting and obstructing a police officer. With enhancement, however, the maximum sentence was 15 years. Boatman was eventually sentenced to 3 to 15 years in prison. He unsuccessfully moved the trial court to set aside his plea, and the Court of Appeals denied him leave to appeal. This Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals as on leave granted for consideration of whether the defendant's plea was understanding.18 
On remand, in a split, published decision, the Court of Appeals held in Boatman that MCR 6.302(B)(2) requires the trial court to inform a defendant of only the maximum sentence for the underlying offense. It does not require that he or she be informed before pleading guilty of the enhancement created by habitual-offender status. The Court concluded that Boatman
was informed of the maximum sentence for the charged "offense," because  [***7] "[t]he habitual-offender statute does not create a substantive offense that is separate from and independent of the principal charge." Nothing in the wording of the court rule can be construed to require a trial court to address every possible configuration or consequence of sentencing. In accordance with the dictates of MCR 6.302(B)(2), when pleading guilty, the court rule requirement that a defendant be advised of the consequences of his or her plea does not encompass advice  [*691]  extending beyond the maximum possible sentence and any mandatory minimum sentence necessitated by law.19 
The Boatman Court recognized that MCR 6.302 "requires a defendant to be informed of the consequences of his or her plea and, necessarily, the resultant sentence."20  Nonetheless, it concluded that MCR 6.302 does not require notification of the enhanced sentence, even though this conclusion violated the intent of the rule. No appeal was taken from the decision.
Concurring in the result only in Boatman, Judge Servitto would have required trial courts to advise a defendant of the maximum sentence as enhanced by his or her habitual-offender status.  [***8] She reasoned that this status directly affects the possible maximum sentence for the underlying offense, and she opined that "[w]here a defendant's habitual-offender status leads to no separate sentence, such status could only be viewed as part and parcel of the charged crime."21 
This Court has since expressed disapproval with the holding of Boatman. In People v Kade, in a statement joined by Justices Cavanagh, Markman, and Hathaway, I wrote that Boatman should be overruled.22   [**213]  Since Kade was decided, two decisions of this Court have suggested that Boatman is no longer good law without expressly overruling it.
In People v Ruffin, the defendant was incorrectly told that his maximum enhanced sentence was 30 years' imprisonment.23  In reality, as a third-offense habitual offender, the defendant was subject to a maximum of 40  [*692]  years in prison. This Court vacated the sentence and remanded the case to the trial court to allow the defendant to withdraw his plea or be resentenced to no more than 30 years' imprisonment. We noted, in support of our determination to allow the defendant  [***9] to be resentenced to the unenhanced sentence, that the prosecution had conceded that it was the appropriate remedy.24 
Similarly, in People v Lofton,25  the defendant was an habitual offender and was not informed of the enhanced possible maximum sentence before he pleaded guilty. The trial court told him that a felony-firearm conviction would result in a 2-year prison sentence. However, at sentencing, the court imposed a 5-year enhanced sentence as required by statute.26  The defendant did not object. We remanded the case to the trial court to allow him to withdraw his plea or be resentenced to a 2-year sentence of imprisonment on the felony-firearm conviction.27 
Plea withdrawals after sentencing are governed by MCR 6.310(C), which provides:
Motion to Withdraw Plea After Sentence. The defendant may file a motion to withdraw the plea within 6 months after sentence. Thereafter, the defendant may seek relief only in accordance with the procedure set forth in subchapter 6.500. If the trial court determines that there was an error in the plea proceeding that would entitle the defendant to have  [***10] the plea set aside, the court must give the advice or make the inquiries necessary to rectify the error and then give the defendant the opportunity to elect to allow the plea and sentence to stand or to withdraw the plea. If the  [*693]  defendant elects to allow the plea and sentence to stand, the additional advice given and inquiries made become part of the plea proceeding for the purposes of further proceedings, including appeals.28 
A defendant seeking to withdraw his or her plea after sentencing must demonstrate a defect in the plea-taking process.29 
THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF MCR 6.302(B)(2) AND ITS APPLICATION
In its decision in Boatman, the Court of Appeals accurately stated that "an important focus of MCR 6.302 is to ensure that any defendant who has entered into a sentencing agreement has made a knowing, understanding, and informed plea decision."30  It also noted that "[t]his requires a defendant to be informed of the consequences of his or her plea and, necessarily,  [**214]  the resultant sentence."31  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals refused to grant relief because the language of MCR 6.302(B)(2)  [***11] does not specifically require that an habitual offender be advised regarding the effect habitual-offender status has on sentencing.32 
We disagree with Boatman and overrule that decision. MCR 6.302(B)(2) states that the trial court "must advise the defendant . . . and determine that each defendant understands . . . the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense and any mandatory minimum sentence required by law[.]" We hold that, before pleading guilty, a defendant must be notified of the maximum possible  [*694]  prison sentence with habitual-offender enhancement because the enhanced maximum becomes the "maximum possible prison sentence" for the principal offense.
By not telling a defendant the potential maximum sentence because of his or her habitual-offender status, "a trial court is not advising of the 'true' potential maximum sentence."33  Today's holding accurately reflects the intent of MCR 6.302(B)(2), which is that a defendant be informed beforehand of the maximum sentence that would follow his or her plea of guilty.34 
In the case before us, there was a clear defect in the plea proceedings. Because defendant was not accurately informed of the consequences of his plea as a second-offense habitual offender, he was not able to make an understanding plea under MCR 6.302(B).35  We must thus decide what remedies are available to him.
  [**215]   [*695]  THE PROPER REMEDY FOR A VIOLATION OF MCR 6.302(B)
We determined in 1981 in People v Jones that a failure to advise a defendant of the maximum possible prison sentence before taking a guilty plea constitutes an error requiring reversal.36  This Court required the trial court to set aside the defendant's plea-based convictions.37  We reaffirm that holding today while incorporating MCR 6.310(C) to permit the defendant to elect  [*696]  either to allow the plea and sentence to stand or to withdraw the plea. A brief review of the history  [***15] underlying the holding in Jones is instructive.
In 1974, in People v Shekoski,38  we adopted a "strict adherence" requirement for procedures governing the acceptance of guilty pleas.39  Our order in that case stated "that strict adherence to those requirements is mandatory and that neither substantial compliance nor the absence of prejudicial error will be deemed sufficient."40 
The next year, in Guilty Plea Cases, we renounced Shekoski and adopted a "substantial compliance" test for errors in plea proceedings.41  However, we retained a rule that required reversal for failure to provide advice concerning the maximum  [***16] possible sentence and any mandatory minimum term.42 
In Guilty Plea Cases, a defendant was informed that by pleading guilty of armed robbery, he was subject to a possible sentence of "up to life." But he was not advised that he might be ineligible for probation.43  We recognized  [*697]  that the precursor of MCR 6.302(B)(2)44  "[did] not  [**216]  require the judge to inform the defendant of all sentence consequences—only the maximum sentence, any mandatory minimum," and "the possible effect on [the defendant's] status as a probationer  [***17] or parolee."45  We concluded that a failure to impart the information required by MCR 6.302(B)(2) continues to require reversal.46 
In 2001, in the case of People v Saffold,47  we elaborated on the substantial-compliance doctrine. Both the majority and the dissent agreed that automatic reversal is not required when a trial court fails to advise a defendant that, by pleading guilty, he or she waives the right to be presumed innocent. Both agreed also that "substantial compliance with MCR 6.302, with regard to the right to be presumed innocent, is all that is required," although the majority and dissent did not agree about the application of  [***18] the substantial-compliance doctrine in that case.48  Saffold is not applicable here, however, because it involved only rights that  [*698]  a defendant gives up by not going to trial49  and the effect of a guilty plea on those rights.
The distinctions we have drawn are supported by our court rules, which differentiate a defendant's trial rights from the consequences of a guilty plea on a defendant's sentence. For example, MCR 6.302(B)(5) allows a written waiver of the trial rights found in  [***19] MCR 6.302(B)(3). It does not, however, allow a written waiver of the requirement under MCR 6.302(B)(2) that is involved in the current case. Because trial rights and sentencing consequences are distinct, Saffold does not apply to our analysis of MCR 6.302(B)(2). And it does not apply to how the statute relates to a defendant's right to be informed of his or her maximum possible prison sentence.
We continue to recognize the distinction we drew in Guilty Plea Cases between information about a defendant's trial rights and information about a defendant's sentence. We note that MCR 6.310(C) now provides the proper remedy for a plea that is defective under MCR 6.302(B)(2), which is to allow the defendant the opportunity to withdraw his or her plea.
Additionally, we are not alone in concluding that the failure to inform a defendant of the maximum sentence that could be imposed before he or she pleads guilty renders a plea involuntary.50  Caselaw supports this  [*699]  determination and holds that an involuntary plea violates the state and federal Due Process Clauses.51   [**217]  For the reasons stated earlier, we hold that defendant entered a defective plea because it was not an understanding plea under MCR 6.302(B)(2).  [***20] We remand this matter to the trial court so that defendant may be afforded the remedy provided in MCR 6.310(C), which provides in pertinent part:
If the trial court determines that there was an error in the plea proceeding that would entitle the defendant to have the plea set aside, the court must give the advice or make the inquiries necessary to rectify the error and then give the defendant the opportunity to elect to allow the plea and sentence to stand or to withdraw the plea.
Because defendant was not informed of his maximum possible enhanced prison sentence before he pleaded guilty, he is entitled to the remedy provided by MCR 6.310(C). Thus, we remand this case to the trial court. On remand, defendant must be given the option of allowing his plea and sentence to stand or of withdrawing his plea. If the plea is withdrawn, the trial court must vacate his conviction and sentence and the matter may proceed to trial.
We reject  [***21] defendant's argument that he is entitled to be resentenced in accordance with the unenhanced maximum sentence of which he was informed at the plea hearing. We hold that MCR 6.310(C) provides the proper remedy for violations of MCR 6.302(B)(2). It requires that a defendant be informed of the maximum enhanced sentence before being given the opportunity to elect (1) to allow his plea and sentence to stand or (2) to withdraw it. Resentencing a defendant to a term  [*700]  within the range the court articulated at an erroneous plea hearing might lead to unfair results. It might create a binding "pleaded to" sentence to which neither the prosecution nor the defendant agreed.
Moreover, resentencing would modify an otherwise valid sentence. As we have said throughout this opinion, the plea procedure was defective here because defendant was not notified of his maximum possible sentence under MCR 6.302(B)(2). On the other hand, the sentence fell within the guidelines for a second-offense habitual offender and is presumed accurate "absent an error in scoring the sentencing guidelines or inaccurate information relied upon in determining the defendant's sentence."52 
Thus, the remedy employed today differs from that used in Ruffin and Lofton. Ruffin is particularly distinguishable from the present action because there  [***23] the prosecution conceded that the proper remedy was to resentence the defendant to the  [**218]  erroneous sentence discussed at the plea hearing.53  Less than a month later  [*701]  we employed the same remedy in Lofton, in which there was no indication that the prosecution conceded to the remedy.54  To the extent that the orders in Ruffin and Lofton are inconsistent with this opinion, they are overruled.
In Kade, we noted that an arguable conflict exists between MCR 6.302(B)(2) and MCL 769.13(3). The statute permits a prosecuting attorney to file a notice of intent to seek an enhanced sentence under the habitual-offender statute after a defendant has entered a plea.55  This Court did not amend MCR 6.302(B)(2) to resolve the tension between the court rule and the statute. But the remedy provided by MCR 6.310(C) will apply when a defendant is not notified of the enhancement until after pleading guilty. MCR 6.302 requires a voluntary and understanding plea. Hence, the concerns about a defendant understanding the consequences of a guilty plea are present when the defendant is notified of possible sentence enhancement only after pleading guilty. Just as in  [***24] the case at hand, a defendant's right to make an understanding plea is of the utmost importance in that circumstance.
CONCLUSION
MCR 6.302(B) specifically gives defendants who plead guilty of a crime the right to know beforehand the maximum possible sentence that will result from their plea. We hold that when a defendant is subject to an enhanced sentence as an habitual offender, that enhanced sentence is part of the maximum prison sentence described in MCR 6.302(B)(2). Accordingly, we overrule the Court of Appeals' decision in Boatman. To  [*702]  hold otherwise would allow a defendant to plead guilty without knowing the true consequences of his or her plea. It would also prevent the defendant from making an understanding plea.
We also hold that MCR 6.310(C) provides the remedy for this violation of MCR 6.302(B)(2). Because the defendant in this case was not given the required sentence-enhancement notice, we remand the case to the trial court. Pursuant to MCR 6.310(C), defendant may allow his plea and sentence to stand or withdraw his plea, in which case the trial court must vacate his conviction and sentence. In the latter event,  [***25] the matter may proceed to trial. We do not retain jurisdiction.

Dissent




Young, C.J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).
For the reasons I have previously stated in People v Boatman,1  I dissent in part from the majority opinion. Despite the majority's claimed "intent" regarding MCR 6.302(B), the court rule actually and explicitly requires only that the court inform a defendant of the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense to which the defendant pleads guilty and does not require the court to inform a defendant of the possible sentencing enhancement resulting from his status as an habitual offender. The "true" maximum possible prison sentence for the offense of second-degree  [**219]  home invasion is as described in MCL 750.110a(6)—"[h]ome invasion in the second degree is a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years or a fine of not more than $3,000.00, or both." Defendant was accurately informed  [*703]  of the sentence for the offense to which he pleaded guilty, and in my view, the sentence meted out was valid in all respects.
While I disagree that there was a violation of MCR 6.302(B)(2), I do agree with the majority on the remedy when such a violation occurs. I concur, therefore, with that portion of the majority opinion holding that the MCR 6.310(C) provides the sole remedy for violations of MCR 6.302(B)(2) when a defendant seeks to withdraw his plea after sentencing. This Court's orders in People v Ruffin2  and People v Lofton3  erroneously permitted the option of specific performance of the unenhanced maximum sentence in contravention of the plain language of the court rule and should not be viewed as having amended the court rule sub silentio. Thus, "[i]f the trial court determines that there was an error in the plea proceeding that would entitle the defendant to have the plea set aside," the court is required to "give the advice or make the inquiries necessary to rectify the error," but the defendant's options are limited to "elect[ing] to allow the plea and sentence to stand or to withdraw[ing] the plea."4 
Aside from the fact that the court rule does not provide for it, several considerations  [***27] militate against permitting a defendant to be resentenced to the unenhanced maximum sentence.
First, if there is a consequential defect in the plea taking proceedings, the validity of the plea itself is called into question. MCR 6.302(A) indicates that a trial court may not accept a guilty plea unless it is "convinced that the plea is understanding, voluntary, and  [*704]  accurate." Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has stated that "a plea of guilty is constitutionally valid only to the extent it is 'voluntary' and 'intelligent.'"5  If a defendant's guilty plea was not an understanding plea, permitting a defendant his preferred remedy of being resentenced to an unenhanced sentence does nothing to cure the invalidity of the underlying guilty plea.
Second, permitting a defendant to be resentenced assumes that the information concerning the unenhanced sentence given by the trial court was a term of the plea bargain agreement, rather than simply incomplete information. In this case, defendant was charged with second-degree home invasion,6  larceny of a firearm,7  being a felon in possession  [***28] of a firearm,8  and larceny in a building9  as a fourth-offense habitual offender.10  Defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion as a second-offense habitual offender11  in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining charges and an agreement by the prosecutor  [**220]  not to charge defendant with possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.12  At the plea proceeding, defendant indicated that these terms were his complete understanding of the plea bargain agreement. Only later was defendant informed that the maximum possible prison sentence for second-degree home invasion was 15 years.  [*705]  Thus, at the time the plea was entered, neither the parties nor the trial court believed that defendant was tendering his guilty plea in exchange for the trial court's preliminary agreement to relinquish its discretion to enhance defendant's sentence as a habitual offender. While I do not believe that the advice given was erroneous, deeming it to be a term of the plea agreement after the fact (in essence, a de facto Cobbs13  agreement) substantially alters the negotiated plea agreement in contravention of the intent of all concerned at the time the plea was originally tendered.
Moreover, even when there is a genuine Cobbs agreement and a defendant's guilty plea is made in exchange for a specific sentence disposition by the trial court, the defendant's remedy is limited to withdrawing his guilty plea if the court is unable to sentence the defendant as stated. Under MCR 6.310(B)(2)(b), a defendant is not entitled to specific performance of a Cobbs agreement. Thus, permitting the remedy of specific performance when a defendant who is an habitual offender is allegedly incorrectly advised regarding the unenhanced maximum sentence provides that defendant with a greater remedy than he would have been entitled to if the unenhanced maximum sentence had been an explicit term of the plea agreement. Defendant's counsel has proffered no reason to support such an enhanced benefit, and I certainly cannot divine a justification for why defendant should be entitled to receive it.
Finally, assuming that the allegedly incomplete information was a term of the plea agreement, permitting defendant the remedy of being resentenced to the unenhanced maximum sentence would essentially permit the trial court to change its mind regarding  [***30] the exercise of the court's sentencing discretion, disregard  [*706]  all the negative information that convinced the court to enhance the defendant's sentence in the first place,14  and allow the modification of a valid sentence. MCR 6.429(A) states that a court may correct an invalid sentence, but may not modify a valid sentence after it has been imposed. I agree with the majority that defendant's sentence of 75 to 270 months for second-offense degree home invasion, as enhanced by his second-offense habitual offender  [**221]  status, is perfectly valId. The infirmity lies, if anywhere, with the plea colloquy.
Because I believe that MCR 6.302(B) does not require the trial court to inform a defendant of his maximum possible prison sentence as enhanced by his status as a habitual offender, I respectfully dissent. I concur, however, that MCR 6.310(C) provides the sole remedy for violations of MCR 6.302(B)(2) when a defendant seeks to withdraw his plea after sentencing.
