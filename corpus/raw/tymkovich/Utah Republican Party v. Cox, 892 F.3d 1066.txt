Opinion




  [*1071]  ORDER
These matters are before the court on the Utah Republican Party's Petition for Rehearing or Rehearing En Banc. We also have a response from the appellee and, per the court's order dated May 30, 2018, a reply in support. In addition, we have also considered the amicus curiae brief of the Institute for Free Speech and we direct the clerk to file that brief formally effective the date of this order. See 10th Cir. R. 29.1.
Upon consideration of all the materials, the request for panel rehearing is denied. A panel majority has, however, concluded that a minor and sua sponte [**3]  amendment of the decision is appropriate. The opinion is, therefore, revised to add a footnote to page 47. The opinion is otherwise unchanged. The clerk is directed to file the attached revised version nunc pro tunc to the original filing date of March 20, 2018.
The appellant's Petition, as well as the response, reply, and amicus curiae brief, were also circulated to all the active judges of the court who are not disqualified. See Fed. R. App. P. 35(a). As no judge on the original panel or the en banc court requested that a poll be called, that part of the Petition seeking en banc reconsideration is likewise denied.
Chief Judge Tymkovich has written separately to concur in the denial of en banc rehearing.

Concur




TYMKOVICH, C.J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc.
I concur in the court's denial of rehearing en banc. The majority and dissent clearly laid out the dueling arguments. I write separately to note the issues raised here deserve the Supreme Court's attention. The panel majority pledges continued faith in an oft-repeated strand of Supreme Court dicta which, as my dissent argues,  [*1072]  has outlived its reliability. At this point, the Supreme Court's homage to State regulation of the primary election [**4]  process is little more than a nod to received wisdom. Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 572, 120 S. Ct. 2402, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2000); see, e.g., American Party of Tex. v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 781, 94 S. Ct. 1296, 39 L. Ed. 2d 744 (1974).
Yet circumstances are much changed. Recent Supreme Court cases like California Democratic Party v. Jones suggest this dicta does not provide the whole truth. So too, do facts on the ground. The behemoth, corrupt party machines we imagine to have caused the progressive era's turn to primaries are now, in many respects, out of commission. In important ways, the party system is the weakest it has ever been—a sobering reality given parties' importance to our republic's stability. And given new evidence of the substantial associational burdens, even distortions, caused by forcibly expanding a party's nomination process, a closer look seems in order. The time appears ripe for the Court to reconsider (or rather, as I see it, consider for the first time) the scope of government regulation of political party primaries and the attendant harms to associational rights and substantive ends.
