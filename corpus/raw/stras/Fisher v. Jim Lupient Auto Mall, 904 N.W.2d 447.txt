Dissent




STRAS, Justice (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent from the court's order in this case because I would have scheduled the case for oral argument in light of the submissions of the parties. See also Tambornino v. Health Risk Mgmt., 787 N.W.2d 540, 541 (Minn. 2010) (order) (Stras, J., dissenting).
