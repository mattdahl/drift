Because Corona failed to properly preserve the Confrontation Clause issue on which the majority relies for quashing the decision on review, I dissent. Under then applicable law, to preserve the confrontation clause issue, Corona was required—notwithstanding any adverse pretrial ruling—to make a specific Confrontation Clause objection at trial. See Spann v. State, 857 So. 2d 845, 852 (Fla. 2003) (requiring specific objection at trial to preserve issue for appeal); Feller v. State, 637 So. 2d 911, 914 (Fla. 1994) (holding that defendant who "failed to renew his confrontation clause objection when [evidence] was actually offered at trial" failed to preserve the Confrontation Clause issue for appellate review). 8  Corona's general hearsay objection at trial was therefore insufficient to preserve the Confrontation Clause issue. Furthermore, I agree with the Fifth District's conclusion that the unpreserved error was not fundamental. Corona's conviction and sentence should be upheld.
