 op. at 28-29; Polston, J., dissenting op. at 43. The phrase "supreme executive power" is not so expansive, however, and to grant such a reading ignores the fundamental principle that our state constitution is a limitation upon, rather than a grant of, power. See, e.g., State ex rel. Kennedy v. Lee, 274 So. 2d 881, 882 (Fla. 1973); Bd. of Pub. Instruction v. Wright, 76 So. 2d 863, 864 (Fla. 1955). Moreover, the dissents' failure to address the provisions of the APA delegating to agency heads the authority to determine whether to go forward with proposing, amending, repealing, or adopting rules—i.e., sections 120.54(3)(a)(1) and 120.54(3)(e)(1), Florida Statutes (2010)—an authority that cannot be delegated by any entity other than the Legislature, demonstrates the absence of support for the position advanced.
In support of the requirements under Executive Orders 11-01 and 11-72, the Governor also relies upon his supervisory power under article IV, section 6 of the Florida Constitution. That provision provides, in pertinent part, as follows: "The administration of each department, unless otherwise provided in this constitution, shall be placed by law under the direct supervision of the governor, . . . or an officer or board appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the governor . . . ." The Governor argues, consequently, that he has the authority—at will—to remove agency heads who serve at his pleasure. See art. IV, § 6, Fla. Const.
The dissents similarly give expansive interpretation to the "serving at the pleasure of the governor" phrase in article IV, section 6 of the Florida Constitution. See Canady, C.J., dissenting op. at 28-29; Polston, J., dissenting op. at 43. Apparently, the dissents believe that the Legislature only intended that the agency head not be permitted to redelegate or transfer the delegated power to approve pursuant to section 120.54(1)(k), Fla. Stat. (2010) within the agency, and that, in light of the Governor's gatekeeper role in deciding what rules would be proposed, the agency head's role pursuant to sections 120.54(3)(a)(1) and 120.54(3)(e)(1) is nothing more than that of a figurehead, whose authority is purely illusory.
We reject the Governor's and the dissents' interpretation of article IV, section 6 of the Florida Constitution; the power to remove is not analogous to the power to control. This is particularly the case where the delegated authority is a legislative function and the Legislature has expressly placed the power to act on the delegated authority in the department head, and not in the Governor or the Executive Office of the Governor. See § 20.05(1)(a), (e), Fla. Stat. (2010). In this case, Executive Orders 11-01 and 11-72 supplant legislative delegations by redefining the terms of those delegations through binding directives to state agencies, i.e., first by suspending and terminating rulemaking, second, by requiring agencies to submit to OFARR any amendments or new rules the agency would want to propose, and then by causing OFARR to interject itself as the decisive entity as to whether and what will be proposed.
 Legislative Delegation to Executive or Amendment to Chapter 12013 
Finally, the last possible source of authority for the Governor's action in requiring  prior approval by OFARR before the legislative delegation of rulemaking may occur would be by either legislative delegation or direct amendment to Chapter 120. The Legislature previously has, in specifically delineated terms and circumstances, delegated to the Executive Office of the Governor certain responsibility for the oversight of rulemaking. See, e.g., § 14.2015, Fla. Stat. (2010),14  and § 288.7015, Fla. Stat. (2010). These two statutes demonstrate that the Legislature understands how to confer upon the Governor the authority to oversee agency rulemaking when it so desires. See Cason v. Fla. Dep't of Mgmt. Servs., 944 So. 2d 306, 315 (Fla. 2006) ("In the past, we have pointed to language in other statutes to show that the Legislature 'knows how to' accomplish what it has omitted in the statute in question").15 
Another possible source of delegation of rulemaking authority to the Governor would be by amendment to the APA with specific provisions directed to the Executive Office of the Governor. With the enactment of section 120.745, Florida Statutes, on June 24, 2011, upon the Governor's signature of House Bill 993, see Ch. 2011-225, § 5, Laws of Fla., the Legislature essentially approved the process by which OFARR reviews agency rules that have already been promulgated. However, by its own terms, section 120.745, which pertains to legislative review of agency rules, is limited to those rules "in effect on or before November 16, 2010." Thus, the recent amendment to Chapter 120 applies to only the process by which OFARR reviews existing rules; in contrast, it does not authorize the provisions in Executive Orders 11-01 and 11-72 that suspend or terminate rulemaking.
 III. CONCLUSION
We distinguish between the Governor's constitutional authority with respect to the provisions of the executive orders pertaining to review and oversight of rulemaking within the executive agencies under his control, and the Legislature's lawmaking authority under article III, section 1 of the Florida Constitution. The Legislature retains the sole right to delegate rulemaking authority to agencies, and all provisions in  both Executive Order 11-01 or 11-72 that operate to suspend rulemaking contrary to the APA constitute an encroachment upon a legislative function. We grant Whiley's petition but withhold issuance of the writ of quo warranto. We trust that any provision in Executive Order 11-72 suspending agency compliance with the APA, i.e., rulemaking, will not be enforced against an agency at this time, and until such time as the Florida Legislature may amend the APA or otherwise delegate such rulemaking authority to the Executive Office of the Governor.
It is so ordered.
