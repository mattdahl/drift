Because I disagree with the majority's conclusion that Branch has a due process right to be competent during the Ryce Act commitment proceedings, I dissent. I do not agree with the majority's view that Branch's incompetence at the time of his trial rendered the provision of the Ryce Act permitting the admission of hearsay testimony unconstitutional as applied to Branch. 
Although a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to not be tried while incompetent, the defendant in a civil action ordinarily has no similar right. See Fla. R. Civ.  P. 1.210(b). As the majority acknowledges, proceedings under the Ryce Act are civil proceedings. I am not convinced that due process requires that an exception from the principle allowing civil litigation against incompetent defendants be made for Ryce Act respondents-even under the specific circumstance addressed by the majority opinion. 
Unlike the majority, I would adopt the view expressed in Cubbage and Nixon that there is no basis for requiring the competency  of persons subject to proceedings for commitment as sexually violent predators. The requirement imposed by the majority is in tension with the nature of proceedings under the Ryce Act. As the court observed in Nixon, 129 S.W. 3d at 8: "The very nature of civil commitments is that they commit for treatment those who pose a danger to themselves or others because they suffer from a mental disease or defect and are unable to comprehend reality or to respond to it rationally." The point applies not only to persons subject to traditional civil commitment proceedings but also to those who are subject to commitment as sexually violent predators. 
Such persons must suffer from "a mental abnormality or   personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment." ยง 394.912(10)(b) (emphasis added); see also ยง 394.912(5) (" 'Mental abnormality' means a mental condition affecting a person's emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses."). Such "a mental abnormality or personality disorder" will not necessarily result in legal incompetency, but it may well have that consequence. It therefore is anomalous to require that in Ryce Act proceedings the persons who suffer from the requisite mental abnormality or personality disorder also be competent. 
I also agree with the analysis in Cubbage which supports the conclusion that the respondent in a sexually violent predator commitment proceeding "does not have a fundamental right to be competent," 671 N.W.2d at 447, and that a statutory scheme permitting the commitment of incompetent sexually violent predators is consistent with the requirements of substantive due process because there is " 'a reasonable fit between the governmental purpose and the means chosen to advance that purpose.' " Id. at 448 (quoting In re Detention of Garren, 620 N.W.2d 275, 285 (Iowa 2000)). 
Furthermore, I find nothing in Florida law or federal law which requires the result reached by the majority. The majority states that 
taken together, Jenkins and Williams stand for the proposition that a Ryce Act respondent has a due process right to challenge the factual assertions contained in the police reports and other documents that underlie an expert's opinion when those factual assertions have neither been admitted through a plea nor tested at trial.
The majority moves from this point-to which I do not take exception-to the conclusion that "in order to meaningfully exercise that due process right, a Ryce Act respondent must be competent so that he or she may both testify on his or her own behalf and assist counsel in challenging the alleged facts." Although I acknowledge that ordinarily a competent litigant will be in a better position than an incompetent litigant to take advantage of the benefits afforded by due process, that does not mean that the due process provided an incompetent litigant is "simply illusory.  " If that were the case, the due process afforded to all incompetent civil defendants would be "simply illusory," and the general rule allowing civil litigation against incompetent persons would be unconstitutional. The ability of counsel and a guardian ad litem to defend the interests of an incompetent respondent in a Ryce Act proceeding by challenging the evidence relied on by the State and introducing contradictory evidence provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
Nor am I persuaded that Carter governs the disposition of the instant case. Admittedly, Carter, 706 So. 2d at 875, established that "a judicial determination of competency  is required when there are reasonable grounds to believe that a capital defendant is incompetent to proceed in postconviction proceedings in which factual matters are at issue, the development or resolution of which require the defendant's input." Furthermore, the holding in Carter was based on "considerations of due process" and thus was "constitutional in nature." Ferguson v. State, 789 So. 2d 306, 311 (Fla. 2001). Carter is distinguishable from the instant case, however, because capital postconviction proceedings, although civil in nature, are fundamentally different from Ryce Act civil commitment proceedings. Capital postconviction proceedings determine whether sentences of death will be carried out. Ryce Act proceedings determine whether individuals will be committed for treatment as sexually violent predators. In one case, the question at issue is whether the most severe punishment will be imposed; in the other, the question is whether treatment will be provided-admittedly in a context that involves a deprivation of liberty.
The Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that "death is different" and has imposed heightened requirements to ensure the fairness of proceedings that lead to the imposition of a sentence of death. See Amendments to Fla. R. Crim. P. & Fla. R. App. P., 875 So. 2d 563, 567-68 (Fla. 2004) (Cantero, J., concurring) ("As we have repeatedly recognized, 'death is different.' "). See, e.g., Walker v. State, 707 So. 2d 300, 319 (Fla. 1997); Crump v. State, 654 So. 2d 545, 547 (Fla. 1995). The dynamics of a capital case and those of a noncapital case are different not just in degree, but in kind. A death penalty case, involving the ultimate penalty, invokes a host of pre- and post-trial procedures, as well as requirements for court and counsel, that do not exist in any other context."). I conclude that it is unwarranted to extend the principle adopted in Carter with respect to capitol postconviction proceedings to the wholly dissimilar context of Ryce Act proceedings. 
If Carter is applicable in the context presented by the instant case, I can see no reason that it would not apply in all Ryce Act proceedings in which factual issues are in dispute, which in practice means every Ryce Act case. It is also true that the use of hearsay evidence is an integral part of the statutory scheme under the Ryce Act. See In re Commitment of Cartwright, 870 So. 2d 152, 162 (Fla. 2d DCA 2004) ("Invalidation of the legislative provision permitting the consideration of reliable hearsay evidence in Ryce Act proceedings would fundamentally alter the nature of those proceedings and disrupt the substantive statutory scheme established by the legislature for the civil commitment of sexually violent predators."). Thus the limitation of the rule articulated by the majority to cases in which hearsay evidence is relied on by the State is in reality no limitation at all. 
For the foregoing reasons, I would reject Branch's due process claim and affirm the order committing him under the Ryce Act.
