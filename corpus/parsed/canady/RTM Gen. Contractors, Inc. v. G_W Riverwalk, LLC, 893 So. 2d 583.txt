CANADY, Judge, Specially concurring.
I concur with the majority's decision to affirm. In my view, however, the summary judgment can be affirmed simply on the basis that our earlier decision in RTM II established as the law of the case that the contracts between Riverwalk and RTM were unenforceable. Although our decision in RTM II was a per curiam affirmance without opinion, that decision necessarily determined that the subject contracts were unenforceable. In addition, RTM has failed to present a sufficient argument to support the conclusion that  application of the law of the case will result in a manifest injustice. See Fla. Dep't of Transp. v. Juliano, 801 So. 2d 101, 105-06, 108 (Fla. 2001); Klak v. Eagles' Reserve Homeowners' Ass'n, 862 So. 2d 947 (Fla. 2d DCA 2004).
