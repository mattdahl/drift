Because I conclude that the City of St. Petersburg was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of probable cause, I dissent from the majority's affirmance of the judgment against the City. Although Officer Douglas arrested Mr. Austrino on the basis of information that ultimately was determined to be inaccurate, I conclude that at the time Officer Douglas  made the arrest, he had an adequate basis for determining that probable cause existed.
Among the issues raised by the City on appeal is the claim that the trial court erred in denying the City's motion for summary judgment on the question of probable cause. The City argues that the undisputed material facts before the trial court on the City's motion for summary judgment showed that the arrest of Mr. Austrino was based on probable cause and the City was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Our review of the trial court's denial of the City's motion for summary judgment is de novo. See Volusia County v. Aberdeen at Ormond Beach, L.P., 760 So. 2d 126, 130 (Fla. 2000). When the facts material to a probable cause determination are undisputed, the existence of probable cause " 'is for the court to decide as a question of law.' " Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Mancusi, 632 So. 2d 1352, 1357 (Fla. 1994) (quoting Cold v. Clark, 180 So. 2d 347, 349 (Fla. 2d DCA 1965)).


The constitutional validity of a warrantless arrest turns on whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make it-whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that [the person arrested] had committed or was committing an offense.


Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 13 L. Ed. 2d 142, 85 S. Ct. 223 (1964); see also Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 160 L. Ed. 2d 537, 125 S. Ct. 588, 593 (2004) ("Whether probable cause exists depends upon the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from facts known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest."). The "standard of probable cause" is "only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity." Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 419, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637, 89 S. Ct. 584 (1969) (citing Beck, 379 U.S. at 96). "[T]he nature of the [probable cause] determination itself . . . does not require the fine resolution of conflicting evidence that a reasonable-doubt or even a preponderance standard demands." Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 121, 43 L. Ed. 2d 54, 95 S. Ct. 854 (1975). 
Here the undisputed material facts on the motion for summary judgment showed that: (1) The "1" appearing in the refill blank on the prescription was printed in a different style and with a different type of ink than the other 1s on the prescription. (2) Officer Douglas was told by the complaining pharmacist that she had verified by phone with St. Anthony's Hospital-through nursing personnel who consulted Mr. Austrino's chart-that the prescription for Vicodin issued to Mr. Austrino had no authorized refills. (3) Officer Douglas had in previous cases relied on information provided by the complaining pharmacist in making arrests for criminal offenses involving prescriptions. (4) The complaining pharmacist had never previously provided information to Officer Douglas that was inaccurate. (5) The prescription was presented to the pharmacy on behalf of Mr. Austrino. These undisputed facts are sufficient to establish probable cause for the arrest of Mr. Austrino for a violation of section 893.13(7)(a)(9). 
As a basis for the trial court's denial of the City's motion for summary judgment, the majority points to conflicts in the evidence concerning whether Officer Douglas had claimed to have personally called the prescribing physician before arresting Mr. Austrino. But any conflict on that factual point was not material. "Issues of nonmaterial facts are irrelevant" to the determination of a motion for summary judgment.  Cont'l Concrete, Inc. v. Lakes at LaPaz III Ltd. P'ship, 758 So. 2d 1214, 1217 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000); see also Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.510(c). "A material fact, for summary judgment purposes, is a fact that is essential to the resolution of the legal questions raised in the case." Cont'l Concrete, 758 So. 2d at 1217. Here, the record is clear that the City conceded that Officer Douglas had not made contact with the physician prior to the arrest. In his deposition testimony, Officer Douglas admitted that he had not contacted the physician. That testimony was consistent with the physician's deposition testimony. Whether Officer Douglas had made inconsistent statements on that point to a fellow officer was not relevant to the critical issue of whether the information he had undisputedly received from the pharmacist provided a sufficient basis for probable cause. 
The majority also states that there was a factual dispute concerning the pharmacist's notation on the back of the prescription that her contact at the hospital had verified that the prescribing physician had not authorized the refill. But it was undisputed that such a notation was made by the pharmacist. And the basis for that notation-the pharmacist's contact with nursing staff at the hospital who consulted Mr. Austrino's chart-was similarly undisputed. 
In short, this is not a case in which "the facts relied on to prove [the existence or] lack of probable cause are in dispute." Liabos, 215 So. 2d at 488. What is in dispute here is not the material facts, but the legal significance of the undisputed material facts.
The crucial legal issue turns on whether the arresting officer reasonably relied on the information provided to him by the complaining pharmacist. Contrary to the majority, I conclude that the information relied on by Officer Douglas was "reasonably trustworthy" and "sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that" Mr. Austrino had committed the offense for which he was arrested. Beck, 379 U.S. at 91. The information on which Officer Douglas relied was provided by a pharmacist who was known by Officer Douglas to be a reliable source of information. A prudent person would rely on information provided by a pharmacist concerning a prescription presented to the pharmacy at which the pharmacist was employed-particularly when the pharmacist had provided reliable information in the past. And Officer Douglas had no basis for doubting the accuracy of the information provided by St. Joseph's Hospital to the complaining pharmacist concerning the lack of authorization for a refill. A prudent person would be justified in believing that the hospital records-which were the underlying basis for the information-concerning a prescription for a controlled substance would be accurate and complete. As Officer Douglas stated in his deposition testimony concerning the omission from Mr. Austrino's chart at the hospital of any indication that a refill was authorized:

He [-I.e., the prescribing physician-] ain't giving aspirin here. He is giving out a controlled substance. There is a big difference giving aspirin to somebody and not putting it in the chart and giving them a prescription for Vicodin which is a controlled substance,-which is-the most abused substance on the market is Vicodin right now.
"[P]robable cause, . . . as the very name implies, . . . deals with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act." Brinegar, 338 U.S. at 175. It is reasonable to rely on pharmacists and hospital  staff with respect to reports concerning the dispensing of pharmaceuticals, particularly controlled substances. The practice of pharmacy is "a learned profession." ยง 465.002, Fla. Stat. (1997). Pharmacists are licensed and heavily regulated under chapter 465. The prescription drug involved here, Vicodin-which contains hydrocodone-is a controlled substance. See Hayes v. State, 750 So. 2d 1, 1 (Fla. 1999). Hydrocodone is governed by section 893.03(3). While a pharmacist can dispense such substances by oral prescription, the prescription must promptly be reduced to writing by the pharmacist. ยง 893.04(1)(a). Section 893.04 contains numerous requirements for prescriptions for controlled substances concerning content and retention of prescriptions, including dating and signing the prescriptions and documenting the filling pharmacist, prescriber, patient, and number of refills. This section also includes label requirements for drug identification and warnings concerning use and prohibition against transfer.
Florida law specifically recognizes the practice of prescribing medicine by telephone, including the telephonic issuing of prescriptions by a physician's staff. Included in the statutory definition of prescription is "an orally transmitted order by the lawfully designated agent of [the prescribing] practitioner." ยง 465.003(14). Since medicine is routinely prescribed by telephone and dispensed on the basis of such oral orders, it was reasonable for the pharmacist in this matter to rely on information from hospital staff as to the content of the prescription written by the emergency room doctor. In turn, it also was reasonable for the police officer to rely on the pharmacist to accurately report to him the information obtained from the doctor's staff. 
The fact that the information that no refill was authorized was inaccurate does not mean that it was unreasonable for Officer Douglas to rely on it. See Harris v. Eckerd Corp., 796 So. 2d 719 (La. Ct. App. 2001) (affirming summary judgment in favor of city on false arrest claim where arresting officer relied on information provided by complaining pharmacist and that pharmacist had contacted wrong physician's office and had obtained inaccurate information concerning prescription). As the majority acknowledges, the fact that information relied on by the arresting officer is "ultimately found to be mistaken" does not negate the existence of probable cause if the conduct of the officer was "objectively reasonable" under the pertinent circumstances. United States v. Gonzalez, 969 F.2d 999, 1004 (11th Cir. 1992). "Because many situations which confront officers in the course of executing their duties are more or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on their part." Brinegar, 338 U.S. at 176. "[T]he mistakes . . . of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability[,]" are mistakes that will not defeat a probable cause determination. Id. 
As the majority also acknowledges, probable cause determinations may properly be based on hearsay. See Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327, 79 S. Ct. 329 (1959); see also Smith v. State, 450 So. 2d 480, 480 (Fla. 1984) (holding that the State in "demonstrating the veracity of hearsay information relied on for an arrest" need not show "both the credibility of the informant and the reliability of his information"). But the majority opinion unjustifiably moves from a statement of the principle that "probable cause for an arrest may be based on hearsay" to the conclusion that "[b]ecause of the hearsay nature of the information provided to the pharmacist, it was incumbent upon the officer to further investigate whether there was probable cause to believe  a crime had been committed" (emphasis supplied). 
Hearsay is allowed as a basis for establishing probable cause because there is a fundamental difference between the process for determining that probable cause exists and the process for determining guilt in a criminal trial. See Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 121. A general requirement to conduct a "thorough" investigation of the facts relating to a criminal offense threatens to undermine this fundamental distinction. Such a requirement would in effect impose a standard on law enforcement officers making probable cause determinations that "goes much too far in confusing and disregarding the difference between [w]hat is required to prove guilt in a criminal case and what is required to show probable cause for arrest." Brinegar, 338 U.S. at 172-73. As a practical matter, the adoption of such a requirement would be a step toward mandating that the police "conduct a mini-trial before arresting" a suspect. Brodnicki v. City of Omaha, 75 F.3d 1261, 1264 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding that police did not have a duty to investigate defendant's alibi before making probable cause determination). 
Probable cause does not require that the police conduct what is determined by hindsight to have been a thorough investigation. A requirement to further investigate the basis for probable cause is applicable only when the circumstances give the officer good reason to be suspicious concerning the reliability of the incriminating information known to the officer. An investigation leading to an arrest must be thorough only in the sense that it is sufficient to produce reasonably trustworthy information that is a proper basis for probable cause. See Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't, 377 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2004) ("[T]he law is clear that once police officers are presented with probable cause to support an arrest, no further investigation is required at that point."); Klein v. Long, 275 F.3d 544, 551 (6th Cir. 2001) (stating that "known exculpatory evidence" must be considered by officers "in their assessment of probable cause" but that "once a police officer has sufficient probable cause to arrest, he need not investigate further"); Guzell v. Hiller, 223 F.3d 518, 519-20 (7th Cir. 2000) ("Police are entitled to base an arrest on a citizen complaint, whether of a victim . . . or a nonvictim witness, without investigating the truthfulness of the complaint, unless . . . they have reason to believe it's fishy."); Wadkins v. Arnold, 214 F.3d 535, 541 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that officer's failure to verify forgery with person whose name was believed to have been forged by defendant did not defeat probable cause determination and stating that "[a]lthough an officer may not disregard readily available exculpatory evidence of which he is aware, the failure to pursue a potentially exculpatory lead is not sufficient to negate probable cause"); Torchinsky v. Siwinski, 942 F.2d 257, 264 (4th Cir. 1991) ("It will, of course, always be possible to contend in court that an arresting officer might have gathered more evidence, but judges cannot pursue all the steps a police officer might have taken that might have shaken his belief in the existence of probable cause. . . . [W]ith hindsight it becomes far easier to portray any person charged with making a close discretionary decision in a pejorative light."); Marx v. Gumbinner, 905 F.2d 1503, 1507 n.6 (11th Cir. 1990) (stating that arresting officers "were not required to forego arresting [the suspect] based on initially discovered facts showing probable cause simply because [the suspect] offered a different explanation"); Krause v. Bennett, 887 F.2d 362, 371 (2d Cir. 1989) (quoting United States v. Manley, 632 F.2d 978, 984 (2d Cir. 1980)) ("It  bears repeating that probable cause does not require an officer to be certain that subsequent prosecution of the arrestee will be successful. 'It is therefore of no consequence that a more thorough or more probing investigation might have cast doubt upon' the situation."); Schertz v. Waupaca County, 875 F.2d 578, 583 (7th Cir. 1989) ("[O]nce police officers have discovered sufficient facts to establish probable cause, they have no constitutional obligation to conduct any further investigation in the hopes of uncovering potentially exculpatory evidence."); Criss v. City of Kent, 867 F.2d 259, 263 (6th Cir. 1988) ("A policeman . . . is under no obligation to give any credence to a suspect's story nor should a plausible explanation in any sense require the officer to forego arrest pending further investigation if the facts as initially discovered provide probable cause."). 
The cases stating that an officer should have further investigated the basis for probable cause before making an arrest are cases in which there was some salient circumstance indicating that the information on which the officer relied was not trustworthy. None of the cases relied on by the majority holds that once an officer has reasonably trustworthy information that a crime has been committed the officer must refrain from conducting an arrest until he has further verified the accuracy of that reasonably trustworthy information. Nor do any of those cases support the conclusion that an arrest for a felony offense involving a prescription for a controlled substance-or for any other felony offense-can be made only during normal business hours. 
Would it have been a better practice for Officer Douglas to obtain additional evidence before arresting Mr. Austrino? The answer to that question is most certainly "yes." But that does not mean that the arrest of Mr. Austrino was not based on probable cause. Was Mr. Austrino's arrest in some sense wrongful? The answer to that question is also obviously "yes." Any time a person is arrested for a crime that person did not in fact commit the person has suffered an indignity that is ultimately unjustified. But our law does not afford a remedy to all of the people who are arrested for crimes they did not commit. An arrest is wrongful in the eyes of the law, and a remedy is provided for the wrong only if probable cause for the arrest was lacking. Here, the undisputed facts showed that the arrest of Mr. Austrino was based on probable cause. The City therefore was entitled to summary judgment.
