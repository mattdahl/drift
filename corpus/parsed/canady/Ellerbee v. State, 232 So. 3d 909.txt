CANADY, J., concurring in result.
I agree with the majority's conclusion that Ellerbee is entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim regarding the penalty phase proceedings. See majority op. at 28-29. I therefore concur with the decision to vacate the sentence of death.
POLSTON, J., concurs.
LAWSON, J., concurring specially.
I fully concur in the majority opinion except for the conclusion that Ellerbee is entitled to relief pursuant to Hurst v. State, 202 So. 3d 40 (Fla. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2161, 198 L. Ed. 2d 246 (2017), and Mosley v. State, 209 So. 3d 1248 (Fla. 2016). For reasons explained in Okafor v. State, 225 So. 3d 768, 775-76 (Fla. 2017) (Lawson, J., concurring specially), I specially concur in that portion of the opinion granting Hurst relief.
