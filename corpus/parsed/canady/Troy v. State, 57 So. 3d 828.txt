 in part and dissenting in part.
I concur in the decision to affirm the denial of postconviction relief. But for reasons I previously expressed in Darling v. State, 45 So. 3d 444, 455-60 (Fla. 2010) (Canady, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), I dissent from the majority's conclusion that chapter 27, Florida Statutes, "permits CCRC attorneys to represent capital defendants in section 1983 mode-of-execution claims." Majority op. at 26.
QUINCE, J., concurs.
