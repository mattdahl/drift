I disagree with the majority's decision to vacate Herring's death sentence and impose a life sentence. For the reasons I have explained in my dissent in Walls v. State, 213 So. 3d 340, 2016 Fla. LEXIS 2328, *23, 41 Fla. L. Weekly S 466, S 470 (Fla. Oct. 20, 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting), I have concluded that Hall v. Florida, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2014), should not be given retroactive effect. But even assuming that Hall applies retroactively, I would still disagree with the decision to impose a life sentence for the reasons explained below.
By vacating Herring's death sentence and imposing a life sentence, the majority has essentially deprived the State of its right to appeal the trial court's 2009 findings that Herring met the second and third prongs of the intellectual disability standard. In its appeal of the 2009 order vacating Herring's death sentence due to intellectual disability, the State argued that the trial court erred in concluding not only that Herring had established that he met the first prong of the intellectual disability standard—significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning—but also that the trial court erred in concluding that Herring met the second and third prongs of the standard—deficits in adaptive behavior and manifestation prior to age 18. See Initial Brief of Appellant at 36-38, State v. Herring, 76 So. 3d 891 (Fla. 2011), 2010 WL 2806167, at *36-38 (arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to recognize that Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.203(b) and section 921.137(1), Florida Statutes, require that the adaptive deficits be current and that the trial court's conclusion that Herring's intellectual disability manifested before the age of 18 was not supported by any evidence). But in reversing the trial court's 2009 order, this Court addressed only the State's argument that the trial court erred in concluding that Herring met the first prong and vacated the 2009 order based solely on that error. This Court did not address the State's arguments that the trial court erred in concluding that Herring met the second or third prongs of the intellectual disability standard. See Herring, 76 So. 3d at 894-97.
Instead of simply reinstating the trial court's previously vacated 2009 order finding that Herring meets all three prongs of the intellectual disability standard, this Court should, as the State has requested, remand this case to the trial court for a new intellectual disability hearing so that the trial court can conduct the "conjunctive and interrelated assessment," Hall, 134 S. Ct. at 2001, of all three prongs as required by Hall. To do so would provide "the type of holistic review" that this Court has stated is necessary in assessing intellectual disability claims in the wake of Hall. See, e.g., Walls, 2016 Fla. LEXIS 2328 at *18, 41 Fla. L. Weekly at S 469 ("[I]t is clear that although Walls has had an earlier evidentiary hearing as to intellectual disability and was allowed to present evidence of all three prongs of the test, he did not receive the type of holistic review to which he is now entitled."). And it would also afford the State an opportunity for a meaningful appeal of the intellectual disability determination under the current state of the law. Accordingly, I dissent.
POLSTON, J., concurs.
