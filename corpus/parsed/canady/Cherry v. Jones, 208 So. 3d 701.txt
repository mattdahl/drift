.
For the reasons I have explained in my dissent in Walls v. State, 41 Fla. L. Weekly S466, 2016 Fla. LEXIS 2328, 2016 WL 6137287 (Fla. Oct. 20, 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting), I have concluded that Hall v. Florida, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2014), should not be given retroactive effect. I would therefore deny Cherry relief.
POLSTON, J., concurs.
