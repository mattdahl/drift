I do not disagree with the reasoning of the majority opinion either on the merits or regarding the conclusion that the reasoning of Meyers is seriously flawed. But I am constrained to dissent because I conclude that this case should be dismissed. For reasons the majority opinion makes plain, the appellant lacks standing to bring this appeal. The proper disposition of such a case is dismissal. I thus would give effect in this case to the abrogation of Meyers and its progeny.
