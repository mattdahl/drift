CANADY, J., concurring in result.
I agree that we should not adopt the proposed rule changes. But I would refer the matter back to the Bar for the development of a proposal that would shift responsibility for providing letters of clearance for certified legal interns from the Board of Bar Examiners to the Bar itself. I believe that the public interest can be adequately protected through the suggested Level 2 background investigation coupled with supervision of interns by members of The Florida Bar. And I believe that this approach can most appropriately be implemented by the Bar. Original Proceeding — Rules Regulating The Florida Bar
