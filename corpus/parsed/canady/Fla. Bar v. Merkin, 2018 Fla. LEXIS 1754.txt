 in part and dissenting in part.
I concur in approving the referee's findings of fact and recommendation of guilt. But I would impose the sanction of disbarment for Merkin's egregious misconduct that was calculated to mislead the investing public. See S.E.C. v. Merkin, No. 11-23585-CIV, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155679, 2012 WL 5245561, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 3, 2012) (entering summary judgment in favor of the Securities and Exchange Commission on claims that Merkin "violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . . . and Rule 10b-5 by making false public statements in connection with the purchase or sale of . . . stock"), aff'd, 628 F. App'x 741 (11th Cir. 2016).
