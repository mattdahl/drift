 in part and dissenting in part.
I would affirm the circuit court's order in its entirety. I therefore dissent from the majority's reversal on the claim regarding Muhammad's inmate and medical records. With respect to that claim, I would conclude that the records are not relevant to any colorable claim cognizable in this proceeding.
I concur in the lifting of the temporary stay.
POLSTON, C.J., concurs.
