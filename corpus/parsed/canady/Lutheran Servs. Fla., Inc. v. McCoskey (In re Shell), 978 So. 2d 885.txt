CANADY, Judge, Concurring specially.
I concur in the decision to affirm the order on appeal. I also concur in the majority's reasoning in support of that decision with one exception. I would affirm on the claim for injunctive relief simply on the procedural grounds articulated in the majority opinion. In my view, it is not necessary to reach the merits of the claim for injunctive relief.
