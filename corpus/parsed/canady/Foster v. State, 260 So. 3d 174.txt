 in part and dissenting in part.
I agree that Foster's Hurst claim should be rejected. I adhere to the view that Hurst should not be given retroactive effect on postconviction review. See Mosley v. State, 209 So. 3d 1248, 1285-91 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). And I adhere to the view that when—as here—a jury verdict has established the existence of an aggravator, there is no violation of the requirements of Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616, 193 L. Ed. 2d 504 (2016). See Hurst v. State, 202 So. 3d 40, 77-82 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2161, 198 L. Ed. 2d 246 (2017). So I concur in result regarding the majority's affirmance of the denial of Hurst relief.
I dissent from the reversal of the denial of Foster's intellectual disability claim. On that issue, I would affirm the trial court. In my view, Hall should not be given retroactive effect on postconviction review. See Walls v. State, 213 So. 3d 340, 350-52 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting).
POLSTON, J., concurs.
