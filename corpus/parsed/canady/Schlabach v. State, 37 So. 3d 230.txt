CANADY, J., concurring in result.
I agree that the reasoning of Abreu v. State, 660 So. 2d 703 (Fla. 1995), requires that the Fourth District Court of Appeal's decision be quashed. I also agree with the referral to the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee of the issue concerning definite reasonable time limitations for the filing and disposition of rule 3.800(c) motions.
POLSTON, J., concurs.
