CANADY, Judge, Specially concurring.
I fully concur with the conclusion expressed in the majority opinion that the  disposition of this case is governed by the precedent established by this court in Donald & Co. I am not convinced, however, that the rule established in that case that waiver of a right to arbitrate may take place without a showing of some prejudice to the adverse party is the rule that we should adopt if the issue were a matter of first impression in this district. Although there is a division among the federal circuits on this issue, the weight of authority-as shown by the cases the majority opinion cites-supports the view that some showing of prejudice is necessary to establish that a right to arbitrate has been waived. See also Carroll E. Neesemann & Maren E. Nelson, The Law of Securities Arbitration, in 1196 Practising L. Inst./Corp. L. & Prac. Course Handbook Series 829, 879 (2000) (stating that in securities litigation "courts generally apply a strict test to claims of waiver" of a right to arbitration and "generally require a showing of prejudice to the opposing party"). I am concerned that allowing a party to an arbitration agreement to avoid arbitration due to the adverse party's nonprejudicial conduct may unnecessarily undermine the arbitration process.
