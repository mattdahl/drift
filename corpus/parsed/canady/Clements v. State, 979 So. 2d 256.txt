CANADY, Judge, Concurring specially.
I concur in the court's disposition of this case. I write separately to explain that I disagree with the holding in Hemphill and would conclude that the tolling provision of section 775.15(7), Florida Statutes (1997), was applicable to the offense charged against Clements. However, even if the tolling provision applied, the prosecution was still untimely.
The final sentence of section 775.15(7) unequivocally provides that the tolling provision applies to any of the offenses codified in section 794.011, Florida Statutes (1997). Among those offenses is the crime of sexual activity with a child by a person in familial or custodial authority. In 1993, this crime, which had previously been codified in section 794.041, was transferred to section 794.011(8). When the crime became a part of section 794.011, it became subject to the tolling provisions of section 775.15(7).
By transferring the crime of sexual activity with a child by a person in familial or custodial authority to section 794.011, the legislature evinced a clear intent to make "any such offense" subject to the tolling provision of section 775.15(7)--unless the prosecution of the offense had been barred prior to being made subject to the tolling provision. See Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 632-33, 123 S. Ct. 2446, 156 L. Ed. 2d 544 (2003) (holding "that a law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution"); Andrews v. State, 392 So. 2d 270, 271 (Fla. 2d DCA 1980) ("The legislature can extend the limitations period without violating the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws if it (a) does so before prosecution is barred by the old statute, and (b) clearly indicates that the new statute is to apply to cases pending when it becomes effective."); Scharfschwerdt v. Kanarek, 553 So. 2d 218, 220 (Fla. 4th DCA 1989) (applying the principle articulated in Andrews to section 775.15(7)). Even liberally construing the statute in favor of the defendant, the tolling provision cannot reasonably be understood as excluding from the scope of its operation every offense of sexual activity  with a child by a person in familial or custodial authority that was committed prior to October 1, 1993. The statutory section in which the crime was codified at the time of the offense is irrelevant to the operation of the tolling provision.
I thus disagree with the view adopted in Hemphill. In my view, Hemphill is based on a hyperformalistic reading of section 775.15(7)--a reading which is inconsistent with the manifest legislative purpose.
Even if Hemphill had been decided differently and the tolling provision did apply here, the result would be the same. The alleged abuse of the victim by Clements was reported to DCF in 1994, thereby triggering the four-year statute of limitations. The amended information was not filed until September 1999, more than four years after the violation was reported. Therefore, the prosecution was untimely even considering the tolling provision.
