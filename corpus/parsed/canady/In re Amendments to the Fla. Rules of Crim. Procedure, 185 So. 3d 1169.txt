RULE 3.800. CORRECTION, REDUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF SENTENCES  
(a) Correction.
(1) Generally. A court may at any time correct an illegal sentence imposed by it, or an incorrect calculation made by it in a sentencing scoresheet, when it is affirmatively alleged that the court records demonstrate on their face an entitlement to that relief, provided that a party may not file a motion to correct an illegal sentence under this subdivision during the time allowed for the filing of a motion under subdivision (b)(1) or during the pendency of a direct appeal.
(2) Successive Motions. A court may dismiss a second or successive motion if the court finds that the motion fails to allege new or different grounds for relief and the prior determination was on the merits. When a motion is dismissed under this subdivision, a copy of that portion of the files and records necessary to support the court's ruling must accompany the order dismissing the motion.
(3) Sexual Predator Designation. A defendant may seek correction of an allegedly erroneous sexual predator designation under this subdivision, but only when it is apparent from the face of the record that the defendant did not meet the criteria for designation as a sexual predator.
(4) Appeals. All orders denying or dismissing motions under 
this subdivision (a)
shallmust include a statement that the 
movantdefendant has the right to appeal within 30 days of rendition of the order.

legibly handwritten or typewritten, signed by the defendant, and contain either the first or second oath set out at the end of this ruletypewritten or handwritten in legible printed lettering, in blue or black ink, double-spaced, with margins no less than 1 inch on white 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper. No motion, including any memorandum of law, shall exceed 50 pages without leave of the court upon a showing of good cause. Any false statement of a material fact may serve as the basis for prosecution and conviction for perjury. All questions must be answered concisely in the proper space on the form.
(2) Additional pages are not permitted except with respect to the facts that you rely upon to support your grounds for relief. No citation of authorities need be furnished. If briefs or arguments are submitted in support of your legal claims (as opposed to your factual claims), they should be submitted in the form of a separate memorandum of law. This memorandum should have the same caption as this motion.
  (3) No filing fee is required when submitting a motion for postconviction relief.
(4) Only the judgment of one case may be challenged in a single motion for postconviction relief. If you seek to challenge judgments entered in different cases, or different courts, you must file separate motions as to each such case.

(5) Your attention is directed to the fact that you must include all grounds for relief, and all facts that support such grounds, in the motion you file seeking relief from any judgment of conviction.
(6) Claims of newly discovered evidence must be supported by affidavits attached to your motion. If your newly discovered evidence claim is based on recanted trial testimony or a newly discovered witness, the attached affidavit must be from that witness. For all other newly discovered evidence claims, the attached affidavit must be from any person whose testimony is necessary to factually support your claim for relief. If the required affidavit is not attached to your motion, you must provide an explanation why the required affidavit could not be obtained.
(7) Your motion must also be submitted under oath and state as follows:

(d) that you understand all of its contents,
(e) that your motion is filed in good faith, with a reasonable belief that it is timely filed, has potential merit, and does not duplicate previous motions that have been disposed of by the court,
(f) that all of the facts stated in your motion are true and correct, and
(g) that you are subject to sanctions, whether imposed by the court or administratively by the Department of Corrections, including but not limited to forfeiture of gain time, if your motion is found to be frivolous, malicious, or otherwise made in bad faith or with reckless disregard for the truth.
(8) When the motion is fully completed, the original must be mailed to the clerk of the court whose address is     (county where sentence was imposed) County Courthouse,     (address of clerk),
