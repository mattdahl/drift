 op. at 76. Contrary to the dissent's assertions, the issue of a unanimous recommendation is properly at issue in this case. In Hurst v. Florida, the United States Supreme Court instructed that "[t]he judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion." 136 S. Ct. at 624. Nowhere in the opinion is the requirement that this Court may only consider "how we are to apply Hurst v. Florida's Sixth Amendment holding," as the dissent suggests. See Canady, J., dissenting op. at 76. The Hurst v. Florida remand requires only that this Court's proceedings not be inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court's opinion in Hurst v. Florida. 136 S. Ct. at 624. This Court's decision is based on both Florida's constitutional right to jury trial as well as the federal Sixth and Eighth Amendments.
This Court's opinion is firmly rooted in article I, section 22, of the Florida Constitution. As to the Eighth Amendment argument, the last time this Court actually considered an Eighth Amendment argument on its merits was decades ago. See Alvord, 322 So. 2d at 533; Watson v. State, 190 So. 2d at 161. Subsequently, the Court has rejected the claim, providing virtually no analysis and seemingly relying on cases from this Court dating back to the reinstitution of the death penalty, and so it is unclear whether the claim was based on the Eighth Amendment or some other constitutional ground. See, e.g., Hunter v. State, 175 So. 3d 699, 710 (Fla. 2015) (denying this argument by citing to this Court's previous rejection of the same argument); Ford v. State, 168 So. 3d 224, 2015 WL 1741803 (Fla. 2015) (denying Eighth Amendment claim because it "has been repeatedly rejected by this Court"), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 538, 193 L. Ed. 2d 433 (2015); Kimbrough v. State, 125 So. 3d 752, 754 (Fla. 2013) (denying the claim due to this Court's "general jurisprudence that non-unanimous jury recommendations to impose the sentence of death are not unconstitutional"); Robards v. State, 112 So. 3d 1256, 1267 (Fla. 2013); Mann v. State, 112 So. 3d 1158, 1162 (Fla. 2013); Larzelere v. State, 676 So. 2d 394, 407 (Fla. 1996) (explaining that the claim had been "previously rejected" without addressing the merits); Hunter v. State, 660 So. 2d 244, 252-53 (Fla. 1995); James v. State, 453 So. 2d 786, 792 (Fla. 1984) (rejecting the claim based on Alvord).
Following this Court's rejections of the Eighth Amendment argument challenging Florida's capital sentencing scheme for allowing a non-unanimous recommendation of death, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Hurst v. Florida, which did not address the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, there is no United States Supreme Court precedent this Court must follow asserting that the Eighth Amendment does or does not require unanimity in jury capital sentencing recommendations.
Clearly our holding requiring unanimity in the jury's ultimate recommendation is not inconsistent with Hurst v. Florida or any other decision from the United States Supreme Court. Moreover, the issue of unanimity in the final recommendation was  raised before this Court in Hurst v. State, argued before the United States Supreme Court in Hurst v. Florida, raised by Hurst in his Motion requesting imposition of a life sentence,28  and serves to provide a complete analysis of what the Florida and United States Constitutions require before the death penalty can be constitutionally imposed.
For all these reasons, I fully concur in the majority's opinion today.
LABARGA, C.J., concurs.
