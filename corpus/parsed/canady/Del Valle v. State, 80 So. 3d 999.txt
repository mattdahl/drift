The central issue presented by this case, in which the petitioner challenges the constitutionality of section 948.06(5), Florida Statutes (2011), is whether in probation revocation proceedings, the burden of showing inability to pay may be placed on a probationer who has failed to make payments ordered as a condition of probation. The petitioner contends that it is unconstitutional under Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983), and Stephens v. State, 630 So. 2d 1090 (Fla. 1994), to place that burden on a probationer. He argues that the State is constitutionally required to prove the probationer's ability to pay before probation can be revoked based on a failure to pay.
The majority effectively accepts the petitioner's argument by requiring that the State "present sufficient evidence" of the probationer's ability to pay before revocation for failure to pay is proper. Majority op. at 2. Transforming the clear meaning of the statutory text, the majority invokes the avoidance canon and treats section 948.06(5) as merely giving the probationer an opportunity to rebut the State's evidence of ability to pay. Addressing an issue not presented by the petitioner, the majority concludes that the statutory clear and convincing evidence standard is unconstitutional. The majority also concludes that the trial court's revocation of the petitioner's probation without a finding of ability to pay constitutes fundamental error.
For the reasons that I further explain below, I disagree with the majority's interpretation of Bearden and Stephens, its resulting constitutional analysis regarding placing the burden of establishing inability to pay on the probationer, and its conclusion that the trial court's failure to make a  finding of ability to pay constituted fundamental error. I express no view concerning the constitutionality of the clear and convincing evidence standard since the petitioner has presented no argument on that issue.
Neither Bearden nor Stephens addresses the central question at issue here: whether it is constitutional to place the burden on a probationer to establish inability to pay in probation revocation proceedings where the State seeks revocation on the ground that the probationer has failed to make payments required as a condition of probation. Neither case—nor any other authority—provides any basis for declaring section 948.06(5) unconstitutional or for the majority's use of the avoidance canon to rewrite the statute.
Our decision in Stephens does not address the enforcement or constitutionality of section 948.06(5). Indeed, Stephens does not mention the statute. Instead, Stephens simply recognizes the illegality of a plea agreement under which the defendant waived the right to assert in future revocation proceedings the defense of inability to make agreed restitution payments. 630 So. 2d at 1091. Recognizing the illegality of such an unconditional plea agreement waiver by a probationer is a very different matter than recognizing the illegality of placing the burden on the probationer of showing inability to pay.
In Bearden, the Supreme Court addressed a state statutory scheme under which a probationer's inability to pay was treated as "irrelevant" to the revocation decision. 461 U.S. at 673. Bearden condemned the scheme as one of which "automatically turned a fine into a prison sentence." Id. at 674. The Court specifically noted that at the revocation hearing "the petitioner and his wife testified about their lack of income and assets and of his repeated efforts to obtain work." Id. at 673. The court further noted that notwithstanding that testimony, the trial court "made no finding that the petitioner had not made sufficient bona fide efforts to find work." Id. The court concluded that "the record as it presently stands would not justify such a finding." Id. Bearden thus dealt with a scheme which precluded consideration of a probationer's inability to pay. This is a far cry from the statute at issue here—a scheme under which the probationer is given an opportunity to litigate the issue of inability to pay, and the judge is required to consider any competent evidence of inability to pay presented by the probationer.
The Bearden court's statement that "in revocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution, a sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay" must be understood in the context in which it arose. Id. at 672. In that context, the statement simply constitutes a recognition that the reasons for failure to pay are relevant to whether revocation is proper and that it is impermissible to preclude consideration of those reasons. The statement does not transform probation revocation proceedings from adversarial proceedings in which the judge sits as a neutral arbiter into inquisitorial proceedings in which the judge's role is to investigate matters which are not raised by the probationer.
The majority states that section 948.06(5)'s burden-shifting scheme "is constitutionally permissible," majority op. at 27, but then—based on an unwarranted reading of Bearden and Stephens—resorts to "reading into the statute" a requirement that entirely defeats the burden-shifting provision adopted by the Legislature. Majority op. at 25. This is not coherent. It does violence to section 948.06(5), and it does violence to the avoidance canon.  (Not to mention the violence done to Bearden and Stephens.)
The avoidance canon is a rule of restraint that points to the adoption of an interpretation that is consistent with constitutional requirements—and thus avoids ruling a statute unconstitutional—when such an interpretation is among the range of reasonable interpretations that the text of the statute will admit. In the majority's decision, the avoidance canon has mutated from a rule of restraint to a rule of revision. The avoidance canon cannot properly justify the rewriting and the evisceration of a statutory provision in the manner accomplished by the majority decision. If the majority's understanding of Bearden was correct—which it is not—the proper course of action would be to declare section 948.06(5) unconstitutional.
In probation revocation proceedings, "the probationer is entitled to less than the full panoply of due process rights accorded a defendant at a criminal trial." Carchman v. Nash, 473 U.S. 716, 726, 105 S. Ct. 3401, 87 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1985). "[I]t is normally within the power of the State to regulate procedures under which its laws are carried out, including the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion, and its decision in this regard is not subject to proscription under the Due Process Clause unless it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental." Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437, 445, 112 S. Ct. 2572, 120 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 201-02, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977)). Even a criminal defendant may constitutionally be required to bear the burden of establishing that he is not competent to stand trial. Id. Since a state can impose the burden of establishing incompetency to stand trial on a criminal defendant, a state should likewise be permitted to impose the burden of establishing inability to pay on a probationer in probation revocation proceedings—proceedings which are subject to less exacting due process requirements than those applicable in criminal trials.
Finally, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the procedural error of a trial court in failing to make a finding regarding ability to pay constitutes fundamental error. Not every procedural error is equivalent to the denial of due process. I acknowledge that in probation revocation proceedings the petitioner is entitled to "a written statement of the factfinder as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking probation." Black v. Romano, 471 U.S. 606, 612, 105 S. Ct. 2254, 85 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1985). Where the failure to make required payments is at issue, that would include a finding "that the defendant was somehow responsible for the failure." Bearden, 461 U.S. at 665. That does not mean, however, that a trial court's failure to make such a finding will always require reversal.
Here, the petitioner had an opportunity to litigate the issue of ability to pay but simply failed to adequately present the issue in the trial court. The petitioner presented wholly insufficient evidence to establish his inability to pay. Although the petitioner indicated that he had no job, he did not say what efforts he had made to obtain a job. For a probationer to show an inability to pay, section 948.06(5) requires that the probationer establish a lack of resources to pay the amount ordered "despite sufficient bona fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to do so." The petitioner totally failed to show any such "bona fide efforts." On such a record, the trial court's failure to make a finding concerning ability to pay is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See § 59.041, Fla. Stat.  (2011) ("No judgment shall be set aside or reversed, or new trial granted . . . unless in the opinion of the court . . . after an examination of the entire case it shall appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.")
I therefore dissent. I would approve the decision of the Third District in the case on review as well as the Third District's decisions in Gonzales v. State, 909 So. 2d 960 (Fla. 3d DCA 2005), and Guardado v. State, 562 So. 2d 696 (Fla. 3d DCA 1990). I would disapprove Shepard v. State, 939 So. 2d 311 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006), Blackwelder v. State, 902 So. 2d 905 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005), and Osta v. State, 880 So. 2d 804 (Fla. 5th DCA 2004).
LEWIS, J., dissenting.
The majority holds that the requirement of section 948.06(5), Florida Statutes (2011), that a defendant must prove inability to pay restitution by clear and convincing evidence to avoid revocation of probation is unjustifiably onerous and unconstitutional. I dissent.
The majority has failed to demonstrate that section 948.06(5) is unconstitutional, and has incorrectly elevated the due process rights inherent in a revocation proceeding. The loss of liberty inherent in the revocation of probation requires probationers to be accorded due process, but the revocation proceeding is not a criminal trial. See Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972). Florida law is clear that a probation revocation hearing is more informal than a criminal trial, and the burden of proof is lessened because only the conscience of the court need be satisfied. See Cuciak v. State, 410 So. 2d 916, 918 (Fla. 1982). The State is only required to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the probationer committed a particular offense that justifies probation revocation. See Miller v. State, 661 So. 2d 353, 354 (Fla. 4th DCA 1995). Furthermore, hearsay evidence is admissible at probation revocation hearings, see Sylvis v. State, 916 So. 2d 915 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005), and this Court has even held that the right to confront witnesses prescribed by the United States Supreme Court in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), does not apply to probation revocation proceedings, see Peters v. State, 984 So. 2d 1227, 1234 (Fla. 2008). Florida courts have also held that the State has the right to call the defendant as a witness to testify about non-criminal matters in probation revocation proceedings. See Perry v. State, 778 So. 2d 1072, 1073 (Fla. 5th DCA 2001). To revoke probation, a court must only conclude and determine that a substantial violation of the terms of probation occurred. See Wheeler v. State, 344 So. 2d 630, 632 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977). Requiring the probationer to establish inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence is therefore not inconsistent with this Court's recognition that the constitutional protections provided in probation revocation hearings are less than those in criminal proceedings.
The majority also disregards the fact that a probation revocation hearing is not the first time a defendant is afforded an opportunity to contest the restitution order and present evidence with regard to his or her ability to satisfy its financial demands. At the initial restitution hearing, a trial court is required to award restitution to a victim for damage or loss indirectly or directly caused by the defendant's offense and for damage or loss that relates to the defendant's criminal episode unless it finds clear and compelling reasons not to do so. See § 775.089, Fla. Stat. (2011). In the trial court's determination, it must consider the amount of the loss sustained by the victim, see id. § 775.089(6)(a), and the  State bears the burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, the amount of damage or loss sustained by the victim, see id. § 775.089(7). A defendant has the ability to defeat the imposition of a restitution order, or the amount, if he or she successfully contests the validity of any damage or loss allegedly caused to a victim by the defendant's crime. See Fresneda v. State, 347 So. 2d 1021, 1022 (Fla. 1977) (stating that before a trial court may order restitution, the trial court "should give the defendant notice of the proposed restitution order and allow the defendant the opportunity to be heard as to the amount of damage or loss 'caused by his offense.'"). If the trial court awards restitution, the defendant may then appeal that order and contest the validity of the order. See Schuette v. State, 822 So. 2d 1275, 1278-84 (Fla. 2002); Glaubius v. State, 688 So. 2d 913, 914-16 (Fla. 1997). On appeal, if the defendant establishes that the amount of restitution is not supported by competent, substantial evidence, that restitution order may be reversed. See Glaubius, 688 So. 2d at 916 (holding that evidence with regard to the amount of restitution awarded to the victim "must be established through more than mere speculation; it must be based on competent evidence").
Next, a final restitution order is enforceable by the State or victim in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. See § 775.089(5); see also Sims v. State, 637 So. 2d 21, 23 (Fla. 4th DCA 1994). During such an enforcement proceeding, the trial court considers the ability of the defendant to pay through an examination of "the financial resources of the defendant, the present and potential future financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and his or her dependents, and such other factors which it deems appropriate." § 775.089(6)(b). At this stage, a defendant can stop the enforcement of a restitution order if he or she can establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, an inability to satisfy the financial demands of that order. See id. § 775.089(5)-(6); see also Banks v. State, 732 So. 2d 1065, 1070 (Fla. 1999) ("Section 775.089(6), Florida Statutes (1995), provides that ability to pay shall be considered at the time of enforcement of a restitution order—not at the time when the court is weighing the respective needs.").
Therefore, since the Legislature amended section 775.089(6) in 1995, it is clear that during any civil enforcement proceeding a defendant may establish an inability to pay. During such an enforcement proceeding, a defendant has the opportunity to contest a restitution award based on an alleged inability to pay. See State v. Shields, 31 So. 3d 281, 282 (Fla. 2d DCA 2010) ("Further, Mr. Shields' ability to pay the amounts ordered is a factor to be considered at the time of enforcement, not at imposition."); Owens v. State, 679 So. 2d 44, 45 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996). If a trial court finds that a defendant has the ability to pay in an enforcement proceeding and enforces the restitution as a civil judgment, that defendant may again contest the propriety of that order on appeal. Cf. Merrill Lynch Trust Co. v. Alzheimer's Lifeliners Ass'n, Inc., 832 So. 2d 948, 951 (Fla. 4th DCA 2002) (concerning the appeal of a trial court's decision with regard to a petition to enforce a civil judgment under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.570).
Lastly, when a defendant is placed on probation by a trial court, the trial court is required to condition that probation on compliance with any restitution order issued pursuant to section 775.089. See § 948.032, Fla. Stat. (2011). If a defendant does not comply with that restitution order, the trial court may revoke probation. See id. In a revocation proceeding, a trial court shall consider the earning  capacity and ability to pay of the defendant. See id. If the State proves a willful violation of the restitution order by the defendant, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence if he or she is to avoid revocation. See id. § 948.06(5).
The holding of the majority that this clear and convincing burden is unconstitutional is a dubious and obtuse proposition, especially given the extensive due process provided by the aforementioned statutory framework a trial court must follow when it imposes restitution, enforces it, and revokes probation based on the failure to adhere to it. Only when a trial court has placed a defendant on probation, and that defendant faces revocation due to an alleged failure to adhere to a restitution order, will that defendant endure the burden of a clear and convincing standard to establish an inability to pay. See §§ 948.032, .06.
Therefore, because a defendant has had an opportunity to contest the amount of a restitution award before its imposition, and to contest that imposition on appeal, as well as to defeat enforcement of restitution by proving an inability to pay at a lower standard of preponderance of the evidence during an appealable civil enforcement proceeding, the clear and convincing burden placed on a defendant during a revocation proceeding is not unduly burdensome and is constitutional. This burden, especially given the defendant's prior opportunities to contest restitution before a revocation of probation proceeding is commenced, is in accord with the purpose of criminal restitution, which is to "compensate the victim" and to further the "rehabilitative, deterrent, and retributive goals of the criminal justice system." Kirby v. State, 863 So. 2d 238, 242 (Fla. 2003).
Moreover, by placing the burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence on the probationer to prove inability to pay, the Legislature acted in accord with its constitutional power to create an affirmative defense, which includes the ability to place on a defendant a clear and convincing burden when attempting to prove that defense. See § 775.027, Fla. Stat. (2011) ("The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by clear and convincing evidence."); § 826.02, Fla. Stat. (2011) (providing statutory affirmative defenses to the crime of bigamy).
The burden-shifting aspect of this troubling case has also produced dissension among the district courts as to which party should go forward with the burden of proving inability to pay. Although Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 664, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983), and Stephens v. State, 630 So. 2d 1090 (Fla. 1994), both require the court to inquire into a probationer's reasons for failing to pay, both decisions are silent with regard to which party has the burden to prove inability to pay, and the burden that such a party carries. As a result, the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Districts have all implicitly held that the burden is on the State to prove inability to pay in probation revocation hearings, but none have held that section 948.06(5) is unconstitutional. See Shepard v. State, 939 So. 2d 311, 314 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006) ("Despite the language of the statute, where the violation alleged is a failure to pay costs or restitution, there must be evidence and a finding that the probationer had the ability to pay.") (citing Warren v. State, 924 So. 2d 979, 980-81 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006)); Blackwelder v. State, 902 So. 2d 905, 907 n.1 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005) ("[S]ection 948.06(5), despite its plain language, cannot relieve the State of its burden to prove that the violation was willful by proving the probationer's ability to pay.") (citing Osta v. State, 880 So. 2d 804, 807  (Fla. 5th DCA 2004)); Osta v. State, 880 So. 2d 804, 807 (Fla. 5th DCA 2004) ("Although a plain reading of the statute appears to place the burden of proving ability to pay restitution on the probationer, our courts have held that in order to revoke probation for failure to pay restitution the burden is on the State to prove the 'willfulness' of the violation, and in order to prove 'willfulness' the State must provide evidence that the probationer has the ability to pay restitution but willfully refuses to do so.") (citing Stephens, 630 So. 2d at 1090; Hartzog v. State, 816 So. 2d 774 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002)).
Section 948.06(5), however, expresses with indisputable clarity the Legislature's intent to shift the burden of proving inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence to a defendant who asserts such a claim. This burden-shifting element of section 948.06(5) is clear and unambiguous and does not require judicial construction. See State v. Jett, 626 So. 2d 691, 693 (Fla. 1993) ("It is a settled rule of statutory construction that unambiguous language is not subject to judicial construction, however wise it may seem to alter the plain language."). Absent any inconsistencies with the Florida or United States Constitutions, this Court must defer to the Legislature's clear intention to shift the burden of proving inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence in a probation revocation proceeding to the probationer. Further, because the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Districts did not hold section 948.06(5) to be unconstitutional, they should not supersede the Legislature's indisputably clear intent and the clear language of the statute to place the burden of proving inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence on a probationer. The burden with regard to inability to pay set forth in section 948.06(5) is therefore constitutionally sound and the statute must be applied as written. In essence, the approach followed by the First District Court of Appeal in Martin v. State, 937 So. 2d 714 (Fla. 1st DCA 2006), provides the proper constitutional and statutory structure.12 
Conclusion
In accordance with the analysis above, I would hold that before a probationer can be imprisoned for failure to pay restitution or costs of supervision, the State must provide evidence that the failure to pay was willful. The burden then shifts to the probationer to establish inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence. The trial court must make a finding that a willful violation has occurred. Accordingly, I would (1) quash the decision of the Third District below; (2) disapprove all Third District decisions to the extent they allow a probationer to have his or her probation revoked absent an inquiry into ability to pay or a specific finding of willfulness; (3) disapprove all Second, Fourth, and Fifth District decisions to the extent they disregard the burden-shifting required under section 948.06(5); and (4) approve the approach of the First District in Martin.
I dissent.
POLSTON, J., concurs.
