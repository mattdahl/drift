. I dissent. For the reasons I have explained in Robertson v. State, 143 So. 3d 907 (Fla. 2014), I would remand to the trial court to determine whether Mr. Doty has made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal. If he has done so, this appeal should be dismissed. POLSTON, J., concurs.
