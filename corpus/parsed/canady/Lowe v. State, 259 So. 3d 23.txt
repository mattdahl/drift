 specially.
I concur in the opinion except regarding the Hurst issue, on which I would conclude that there was no error. The jury's verdict convicting Lowe of attempted armed robbery with a firearm satisfies the requirement of Hurst v. Florida that an aggravator be found by the jury. See Hurst v. State, 202 So. 3d 40, 77-82 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting).
POLSTON, J., concurs.
