 in part and dissenting in part.
I dissent from the Court's preliminary approval of new standard instructions 403.9 (Negligence); 403.10 (Negligent Failure to Warn); and 403.18 (Defense Issues). Because these particular instructions and certain of the comments associated with them have generated substantial controversy, I conclude that it would be appropriate for the Court to now refrain from  approving these instructions. The Court should defer addressing the contested issues until presented with a proper case for adjudication. I concur with the preliminary approval of the other new standard jury instructions.
POLSTON, J., concurs.
QUINCE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I agree with Chief Justice Canady that we should not authorize for publication or use new standard instruction 403.10 (Negligence Failure to Warn). However, I also conclude that standard instruction 403.18 as modified should be authorized for publication and use.
