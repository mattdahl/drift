 in result.
I agree with the per curiam opinion except for the analysis of the Hurst issue. Although I agree that the Hurst error here is harmless, I also adhere to the view that "[t]he new rule articulated in Hurst v. Florida—which simply requires that the jury find an aggravator—is an evolutionary refinement in the law that does not cast doubt on the veracity or integrity of penalty phase proceedings resulting in death sentences that are now final" and that the new rule therefore should not be given retroactive effect. Mosley v. State, 209 So. 3d 1248, 1291 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
Poole—which corrected this Court's misinterpretation of Hurst v. Florida— dismantled the foundation for the majority's analysis in Mosley. After Poole, Mosley is the ghost of a precedent. The retroactivity issue presented by this case therefore should be determined in light of Poole. And Poole makes clear that Hurst v. Florida was an evolutionary refinement in the law that should not be applied retroactively.
