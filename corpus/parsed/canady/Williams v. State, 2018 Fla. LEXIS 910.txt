CANADY, J., concurring in result only.
Based on the State's concession of error, I agree that the decision of the Second District Court should be quashed to the extent that it affirmed Williams's sentences and that the case should be remanded for resentencing in conformance with chapter 2014-220, Laws of Florida. I do not disagree with the conclusion that the Second District's decision to affirm Williams's convictions was correct, but I believe that it is unnecessary for this Court to address the issue relating to the convictions.
POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.
