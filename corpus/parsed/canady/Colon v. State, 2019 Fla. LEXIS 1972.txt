I concur in the Court's uncontested disposition order. But I write to point out that the Court has never considered on the basis of full briefing by the parties the issue of remedy addressed in Williams v. State, 242 So. 3d 280 (Fla. 2018). In my view, that issue will be ripe for reconsideration when it is properly presented to the Court.
POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.
