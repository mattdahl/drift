 in part and concurring in result in part.
I agree that the postconviction court's summary denial of Bowles' motion should be affirmed, that the habeas petition should be denied and that no stay should be entered. I join in the result as well as the portions of the majority opinion addressing Bowles' claim regarding public records and his habeas petition. But I would reject Bowles' intellectual disability claim on the ground that Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. 701, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2014), should not be given retroactive application. See Walls v. State, 213 So. 3d 340, 350-52 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting). To the extent that Bowles presents a claim under rule 3.203(f) independent of the retroactive application of Hall, I agree with the majority opinion regarding the rejection of that claim.
