 in part and dissenting in part.
I concur with the majority's rejection of the proposal submitted by the Board of Governors. But I dissent from the majority's direction that the Bar propose amendments "that preclude Florida lawyers from accepting referrals from any lawyer referral service that is not owned or operated by a member of the Bar." Majority op. at 6. Instead, I would direct that the Bar propose amendments incorporating the proposals recommended by the Special Committee on Lawyer Referral Services.
