CANADY, J., concurring in result only.
I concur that the Fifth District Court of Appeal's decision should be quashed and  the case remanded with directions to reinstate the convictions and sentences imposed by the trial court. In my view, a variation in the character and type of the proscribed sex acts committed in a single episode is not necessary for the imposition of more than one punishment for lewd and lascivious battery. The instant case, of course, does not address the circumstance where in the course of a single episode, the defendant has committed more than one criminal sex act of the same type against the same victim. Our decision should not be read as denying that separate instances of the same type of criminal sex act in a single episode may be punishable as separate offenses.
