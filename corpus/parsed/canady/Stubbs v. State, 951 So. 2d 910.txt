CANADY, Judge, Concurring specially.
Section 924.06(2), Florida Statutes (2005), provides that "[a]n appeal of an order revoking probation may review only proceedings after the order of probation." (Emphasis added.) The scoresheet at issue here was prepared for Stubbs' original sentencing in 1993. It was necessarily prepared and considered by the trial court prior to the original imposition of sentence. By allowing a probationer such as Stubbs to challenge sentencing points included on the scoresheet used in the proceeding which resulted in the entry of the order of probation, the court has failed to limit its review to "proceedings after the order of probation."
Without any discussion of section 924.06(2)--which first became effective on May 25, 1959 1 --our cases have adopted a rule that appears to be at odds with the statutory requirements. 
 Were I not bound by this court's decisions in Matton, West, Spell, Bogan, and Wright, I would follow the rule articulated in Fitzhugh, 698 So. 2d at 573, that "an appeal from resentencing following violation of probation is not the proper time to assert an error in the original scoresheet."
