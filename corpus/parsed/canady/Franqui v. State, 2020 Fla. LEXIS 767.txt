 in result.
I agree that the decision of the circuit court should be affirmed. But I would reject the intellectual disability claim on the ground that Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. 701, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2014), should not be given retroactive effect. See Walls v. State, 213 So. 3d 340, 350-52 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting). LABARGA, J., concurring in result.
I agree that the circuit court did not err in denying Franqui's intellectual disability claim. I also agree with the denial of Franqui's Hurst-related claims because this Court held that Hurst v. Florida1  and Hurst v. State2  do not apply retroactively to cases where the defendant's death sentence was final when Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002), was decided. See Hitchcock v. State, 226 So. 3d 216, 217 (Fla. 2017).
However, rather than rely on Hitchcock, the majority relies on State v. Poole, 45 Fla. L. Weekly S41 (Fla. Jan. 23, 2020), clarified, 45 Fla. L. Weekly S121 (Fla. Apr. 2, 2020), a wrongfully decided opinion to which I strenuously dissented. Because I conclude that the denial of Hurst relief in this case is correctly based on Hitchcock and not Poole, I can only concur in the result.
