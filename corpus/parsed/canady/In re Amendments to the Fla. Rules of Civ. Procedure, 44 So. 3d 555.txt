Judge
NOTE: Paragraph 1 must be varied in accordance with the items unpaid, claimed, and proven. The form does not provide for an adjudication of junior lienors' claims nor for redemption by the United States of America if it is a defendant. The address of the person who claims a lien as a result of the judgment must be included in the judgment in order for the judgment to become a lien on real estate when a certified copy of the judgment is recorded. Alternatively, an affidavit with this information may be simultaneously recorded. For the specific requirements, see section 55.10(1), Florida Statutes; Hott Interiors, Inc. v. Fostock, 721 So. 2d 1236 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998). [O>The address and social security number (if known) of each person against whom the judgment is rendered must be included in the judgment, pursuant to section 55.01(2), Florida Statutes.<O]
 Committee Notes
1980 Amendment. The reference to writs of assistance in paragraph 7 is changed to writs of possession to comply with the consolidation of the 2 writs.
2010 Amendment. Mandatory statements of the mortgagee/property owner's rights are included as required by the 2006 amendment to section 45.031, Florida Statutes. Changes are also made based on 2008 amendments to section 45.031, Florida Statutes, permitting courts to order sale by electronic means.
Additional changes were made to bring the form into compliance with chapters 718 and 720 and section 45.0315, Florida Statutes, and to better align the form with existing practices of clerks and practitioners. The breakdown of the amounts due is now set out in column format to simplify calculations. The requirement that the form include the address and social security number of all defendants was eliminated to protect the privacy interests of those defendants and in recognition of the fact that this form of judgment does not create a personal final money judgment against the defendant borrower, but rather an in rem judgment against the property. The address and social security number of the defendant borrower should be included in any deficiency judgment later obtained against the defendant borrower.
FORM 1.996(b). MOTION TO CANCEL AND RESCHEDULE FORECLOSURE SALE
