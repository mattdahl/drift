 in result.
I agree that the order summarily denying postconviction relief should be affirmed. I concur in the denial of Bogle's Brady, Giglio, and newly discovered evidence claims. I also agree that Bogle is not entitled to relief on his Hurst claims. But I would deny the Hurst claims on two grounds. First, I would conclude that no Hurst error occurred in this case. I adhere to the view that Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616, 193 L. Ed. 2d 504 (2016), only requires that the jury find an aggravating circumstance that renders a defendant eligible for a death sentence. See Hurst v. State, 202 So. 3d 40, 77-82 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2161, 198 L. Ed. 2d 246 (2017). Here, that requirement was satisfied because the jury's verdict that Bogle had committed "burglary with force . . . on the victim" and her sister two weeks before the murder established  the existence of the prior violent felony aggravator. Bogle v. State, 655 So. 2d 1103, 1105 (Fla. 1995). Second, even if Hurst error were present in this case, I would still deny relief. In my view, Hurst should not be given retroactive application. See Mosley v. State, 209 So. 3d 1248, 1285-91 (Fla. 2016) (Canady, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
