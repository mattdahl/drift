CANADY, J., specially concurring.
I concur in the affirmance of Orme's death sentence. Except for the matters discussed below, I agree with the analysis in the per curiam opinion.
With respect to Orme's claim that the trial court erred in refusing to permit a for-cause challenge to prospective jurors who refused to consider remorse as a mitigating factor, I agree with the majority's conclusion that the claim was not preserved. I would reject the issue on that basis and refrain from reaching its merits.
With respect to the claim that the trial court failed to consider Orme's remorse as a mitigator, I would reject the claim on the basis that it was not preserved. Orme never did anything to bring the supposed  deficiency in the sentencing order to the attention of the trial court. Accordingly, the issue is unpreserved. See Blackwelder v. State, 851 So. 2d 650, 652 (Fla. 2003); Ray v. State, 755 So. 2d 604, 611 (Fla. 2000).
POLSTON, J., concurs.
