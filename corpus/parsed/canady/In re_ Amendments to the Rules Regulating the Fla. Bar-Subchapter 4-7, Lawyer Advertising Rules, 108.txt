Although The Florida Bar has made a commendable effort to improve the current lawyer advertising rules, I am persuaded that the proposed rules remain unduly restrictive. I therefore would reject  the proposed rules and direct that the Bar propose revised rules that go further to address concerns related to the protection of First Amendment rights and of prospective clients' interest in having unimpeded access to information that they consider useful.
I am particularly concerned about the impact of the application of the advertising rules to lawyer websites and the restrictions concerning "unduly manipulative or intrusive advertisements." I also disagree with the rule provisions condemning certain uses of titles by former government officials as deceptive or inherently misleading.
Accordingly, I dissent.
