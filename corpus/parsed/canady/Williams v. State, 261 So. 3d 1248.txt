 in result in part, dissenting in part.
Based on the State's concession of error, I agree that the decision of the Second District Court of Appeal should be quashed to the extent that it affirmed Williams's sentences and that the case should be remanded for resentencing in conformance with chapter 2014-220, Laws of Florida. I do not disagree with the conclusion that the Second District's decision to affirm Williams's attempted murder conviction was correct, but I believe that it is unnecessary for this Court to address the issue relating to this conviction. I dissent, however, from the decision to quash that portion of the Second District's decision that affirmed the first-degree premeditated murder conviction.
POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.
