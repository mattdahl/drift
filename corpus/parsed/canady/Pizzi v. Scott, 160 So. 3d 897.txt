Because the Governor does not have an indisputable legal duty to revoke the executive order that suspended the Petitioner from office, the petition for writ of mandamus should be denied. Accordingly, I dissent.
The Petitioner's purported right to action by the Governor hinges on the meaning of section 112.51, Florida Statutes (2013), which provides that when a suspended municipal official is cleared of the charge on which the suspension was based "the Governor shall forthwith revoke the suspension and restore such municipal official to office."
Ordinarily, the application of this statutory provision would create an indisputable legal duty both to revoke the suspension order and to restore the suspended official to office. Here, however, the Petitioner does not suggest that the Governor has a duty to restore him to office and thus oust the Mayor elected in a special election under the charter of the municipality.
To the extent that the Governor has no indisputable legal duty to restore the Petitioner to office, the Governor likewise has no indisputable legal duty to revoke the suspension order. The statute links the act of revoking an order of suspension with the act of restoring to office. If the act of restoring to office is not required to be performed, it is not clear that the linked act of revoking the order of suspension is required. And it is not clear that the Petitioner would benefit in any way from the act of revocation unaccompanied by an act of restoration.
Given these murky legal circumstances, a proper basis for granting mandamus relief does not exist. "[A] writ of mandamus will not be allowed in a case of doubtful right" and mandamus "will not lie to compel [the] part[y] against whom it is directed to do a vain or useless thing." State ex rel. Bergin v. Dunne, 71 So. 2d 746, 749 (Fla. 1954).
