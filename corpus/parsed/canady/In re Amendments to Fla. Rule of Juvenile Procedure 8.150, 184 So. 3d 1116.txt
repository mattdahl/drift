 in part and dissenting in part.
I concur with the rule changes adopted by the majority except for the provision of new subsection (b) establishing in juvenile direct contempt cases "a right to legal counsel and the right to have legal counsel appointed by the court if the child is indigent."
This rule provision adopted by the majority is inconsistent with section 985.037(4), Florida Statutes (2015). The statute provides for legal counsel only in connection with cases of indirect criminal contempt. See § 985.037(4)(b). Moreover, the statute specifically provides that in cases of direct contempt, "the court may impose an authorized sanction immediately"—which will not be possible under this  rule provision where the juvenile is not already represented by counsel.
No basis has been shown for this Court to adopt this procedural rule granting a substantive right in derogation of a legislative enactment. I dissent from this improper use of the Court's procedural rulemaking authority.
