Because Davis's Eighth Amendment claim that Florida's lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional as applied to him is facially insufficient, I dissent.
To state an Eighth Amendment claim under Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35, 128 S. Ct. 1520, 170 L. Ed. 2d 420 (2008), the defendant has the burden to show that the State's lethal injection protocol is "'sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering' and give rise to 'sufficiently imminent dangers.'" Id. at 50 (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, 34-35, 113 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993)); see Howell v. State, 133 So. 3d 511, 521 (Fla.) (stating "[t]his heavy burden is borne by the defendant—not the State."), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1376, 188 L. Ed. 2d 372 (2014). Moreover, we have held that "[s]ummary denial of a lethal injection challenge is proper where the asserted reasons for holding an evidentiary hearing are based on conjecture or speculation." Chavez v. State, 132 So. 3d 826, 831 (Fla.), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1156, 134 S. Ct. 1156, 188 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2014).
Davis states in conclusory fashion that he may have brain damage and a disease called Porphyria and that he suffers from alcoholism. Thus, Davis contends that he may suffer unconstitutional levels of pain from Florida's lethal injection protocol. The affidavit attached to the motion filed in this Court does not cure this insufficiency. The expert's affidavit was not presented to the trial court and is now without justification introduced in these proceedings by filing in this Court. Accordingly, the affidavit should be stricken. In any event, the affidavit does not explain how or why Davis's alleged medical conditions would prevent Davis from quickly being rendered unconscious by the administration of the first drug in the lethal injection protocol. Nor does the affidavit specifically establish how or why any adverse reaction experienced by Davis would occur before Davis is rendered unconscious. Davis's claims are legally insufficient on their face and do not merit remand.
POLSTON, C.J., concurs.
