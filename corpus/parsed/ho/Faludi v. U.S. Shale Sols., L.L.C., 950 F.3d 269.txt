Under a proper reading of the relevant regulations, Jeff Faludi is not exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act as a highly compensated employee. See Faludi v. U.S. Shale Sols., L.L.C., 936 F.3d 215, 221 (Aug. 21, 2019) (Ho, J., dissenting). Accordingly, as I previously explained, Faludi's entitlement to overtime pay should turn not on whether he is a highly compensated employee, but on whether he is an independent contractor. Id. at 223.
The majority reaches the same conclusion today, correctly noting that "we need not reach" the issue of whether Faludi "fits within the highly compensated employee exemption to the FLSA . . . given that Faludi is an independent contractor not covered by the FLSA's requirements." In doing so, the majority expressly leaves it to a future panel to decide whether an employee like Faludi does or does not qualify as a highly compensated employee under the relevant regulations.
For those reasons, I am pleased to concur in the judgment.
