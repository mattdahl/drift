Federal courts cannot interfere with state criminal convictions, including capital convictions, except under the limited circumstances recognized by Congress and the Supreme Court. Our review is limited, not because Congress and the Supreme Court disrespect constitutional rights, but because they respect "the principles of comity, finality, and federalism." Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 945, 127 S. Ct. 2842, 168 L. Ed. 2d 662 (2007) (cleaned up). Comity and federalism, because we honor the sovereign prerogative of state judiciaries to enforce criminal law and constitutional rights—and finality, because a system of endless appeals is antithetical to the rule of law.
"Federal habeas review of state convictions . . . intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority." Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011). It "frustrates both the States' sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights." Id. So Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 to reaffirm "that state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions"—and that "habeas corpus is a 'guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,' not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal." Id. at 102-03 (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 332 n.5, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment)).
Our reticence to interfere should be particularly acute where, as here, the defendant has been convicted, and the conviction has been repeatedly affirmed, first on direct appeal, and then again and again in multiple rounds of habeas petitions and appeals, in both state and federal court. When all that process has been afforded, when dozens of state and federal judges have reviewed and approved the conviction and sentence, it is long past time for closure—for the victims, for the defendant, and for the legal system.
Federal law reflects this sentiment by forbidding federal courts of appeals from authorizing successive federal habeas petitions, except under extremely narrow circumstances. Among other requirements, there must be "clear and convincing evidence," after taking any new facts "in light of the evidence as a whole," that "but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense." 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).
So we have no choice but to deny authorization to proceed on a successive habeas petition unless "no reasonable juror would have voted to convict." In re Raby, 925 F.3d 749, 758 (5th Cir. 2019). Not surprisingly, we have described the standard as a "strict form of innocence." Johnson v. Dretke, 442 F.3d 901, 911 (5th Cir. 2006) (cleaned up).
This case comes nowhere close to meeting that rigorous standard. Far from meeting a "strict form of innocence," the evidence of guilt is compelling—and certainly sufficient for a reasonable juror to convict:
• Will confessed to shooting Hill just moments after it happened. Shortly after the shooting, he pointed a gun at an innocent bystander, Cassandra Simmons, and ordered her out of her car, claiming that he had "just shot a police officer" and needed her car to flee. (Will denies that he ever confessed to Simmons. But he has offered no credible theory as to what would have motivated Simmons to lie.)
• Not long after the carjacking occurred, Will was caught in Simmons's stolen car, in possession of a loaded gun.
• Subsequent testing confirms that the loaded gun in Will's possession at the time of his arrest was indeed the gun used to kill officer Hill.
• The physical evidence indicated that Will tried to conceal that he had fired the gun. According to the trial record, his clothing was covered with bleach, and he complained to the arresting officer that he had gotten bleach in his eyes. (Simmons later testified she had a bottle in bleach in her trunk at the time Will carjacked her. At the time of arrest, that bottle of bleach was found in the passenger seat.)
• Despite Will's efforts to conceal his acts, his hands tested positive for gunshot residue. (No one has offered an innocent explanation for why Will would have taken the time to cover himself in bleach.)
• The medical examiner testified that the physical evidence supported the conclusion that Will shot Hill while in custody.
Yet Will claims that no reasonable juror would have voted to convict him, despite all of these facts? I find that unfathomable.1 
What's more, Will's own experts admitted that the physical evidence implicated Will as the shooter. According to an affidavit from Will's trial counsel, Will's blood spatter expert told counsel: "[Y]ou do not want to call me as a witness in this case . . . My conclusions are that the physical evidence is consistent with your client shooting the deputy."2 
In response, Will cites two documents that the prosecution failed to disclose until after his first federal habeas petition. But neither document comes close to making it irrational for any juror to convict—particularly against the mountain of trial evidence highlighted above.
First is the report from another officer, Patricia Schifani. According to that report, Rosario bragged that he was "part of the reason" Hill was killed. But Rosario's "part[ial]" role in the events is entirely consistent with the State's theory of the case at trial: Officers found Will and Rosario running from a crime scene. Hill pursued Will, while Kelly pursued Rosario. So there is no question that Rosario played a "part"—and tellingly, only a "part"—in the events that led to Hill's murder.
Second is a jail report ordering that Rosario be keep separate from another inmate, Daniel Cruz. That report contained the following notation: "soliciting $ to make hit on co-def Robt. Will." But notably, the report did not explain why Rosario might have wanted to kill Will. In particular, the report offered nothing that would connect any motive to kill Will with the murder of Hill—as opposed to any other dispute those two felons might have had with one another.
To its credit, the majority is careful to note that this is not a ruling on the merits, but only an authorization of a successive federal habeas petition. But the result should be the same. Because under AEDPA, a "court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection." 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(C) (emphasis added). To authorize this successive petition, then, the majority must conclude that Will has stated a prima facie case.
But the majority admits that neither the Schifani report nor the Cruz separation order constitutes "smoking gun" evidence of innocence. That should be fatal to Will's request for authorization to file a successive petition. Because there is no doubt that the evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to convict—and neither the Schifani report nor the Cruz separation order alters that conclusion. Accordingly, we may not permit this successive habeas petition to proceed, consistent with Congress's instructions. See, e.g., In re Swearingen, 935 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir. 2019) (denying authorization to file a successive habeas corpus petition, noting that "it is not sufficient under § 2244(b) merely to show that evidence 'muddies the waters'") (quoting In re Raby, 925 F.3d at 759).

It is often said that "death is different." True enough. But under AEDPA, the same rules apply. I respectfully dissent.3
