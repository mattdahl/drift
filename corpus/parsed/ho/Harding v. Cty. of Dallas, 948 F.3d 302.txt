, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
In Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 201 L. Ed. 2d 714 (2018), the Supreme Court increased the evidentiary burden on plaintiffs in vote dilution cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. I agree with the majority that, based on the evidence presented at trial, the vote dilution claim in this case fails under Perez.
But Perez was not decided until after the close of trial in this case. Plaintiffs should have the opportunity on remand to meet the new evidentiary standard announced in Perez. For that reason, I respectfully dissent.

For decades, the Supreme Court has applied a two-prong test to assess vote dilution claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301. See Thornburg v. Gingles 478 U.S. 30, 50-51, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 92 L. Ed. 2d 25 (1986). First, the plaintiff must satisfy three threshold conditions, commonly known as the Gingles factors: (1) the racial minority group must be "sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single member district," (2) that minority group must be "politically cohesive," and (3) the majority must vote as a bloc such that it can "usually . . . defeat the minority's preferred candidate." Id. at 50-51. See also LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 425-26, 126 S. Ct. 2594, 165 L. Ed. 2d 609 (2006) (same). Second, if the plaintiff satisfies all three Gingles factors, she must then demonstrate that vote dilution has occurred under the totality of the circumstances test set forth by the Court—in essence, whether a history of racial discrimination exists in the relevant jurisdiction. Id. at 426.
Prior to Perez, the Court made clear that, once a plaintiff is able to meet the three Gingles factors, the vote dilution claim proceeds to the totality of the circumstances test. "If all three Gingles requirements are established, the statutory text directs us to consider the 'totality of circumstances.'" Id. at 425 (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1011, 114 S. Ct. 2647, 129 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1994)). And the totality of the circumstances test is not arduous—once the Gingles factors are met, courts will have "good reason to believe that § 2 requires drawing a majority-minority district." Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1470, 197 L. Ed. 2d 837 (2017). See also Clark v. Calhoun County, 21 F.3d 92, 97 (5th Cir. 1994) ("[I]t will be only the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish the existence of the three Gingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation of § 2 under the totality of the circumstances").
The reason for this framework is simple: Once a plaintiff is able to satisfy the three Gingles factors, courts are satisfied that the minority group will have the opportunity to elect a representative of its choice. See, e.g., Harris, 137 S. Ct. at 1470 ("Those three showings . . . are needed to establish that the 'minority [group] has the potential to elect a representative of its own  choice.'") (quoting Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40, 113 S. Ct. 1075, 122 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1993)).
Perez alters this framework. In addition to the three Gingles factors, Plaintiffs must survive an additional inquiry before reaching the totality of the circumstances test. Plaintiffs must now affirmatively prove that the minority group will have a "real" opportunity to elect representatives of its choice. Perez, 138 S. Ct. at 2333.
So after Perez, it is no longer enough for plaintiffs to draw a proposed district that satisfies the three Gingles factors. It must additionally prove that the proposed district will in fact perform as plaintiffs hope.
This performance requirement is new. No prior Supreme Court precedent required evidence of performance prior to Perez—nor have the parties or the district court cited any. See also Perez, 138 S. Ct. at 2358 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (criticizing majority for requiring evidence of performance); cf. Richard L. Hasen, Suppression of Minority Voting Rights Is About to Get Way Worse, SLATE (June 25, 2018), ("[I]n a pretty brief but significant part of the majority opinion, the court in Abbott seems to make it harder for plaintiffs to win cases under Section 2."), https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/the-abbott-v-perez-case-echoes-shelby-county-v-holder-as-a-further-death-blow-for-the-voting-rights-act.html.
In this case, the district court denied Plaintiffs' vote dilution claim based on Perez. It held that Plaintiffs satisfied the first Gingles factor and presumed that they satisfied the second and third factors as well. It nevertheless rejected Plaintiffs' vote dilution claim—not under the totality of the circumstance test, but because Plaintiffs failed to prove performance. See Harding v. Cty. of Dallas, 336 F. Supp. 3d 677, 694-95 (N.D. Tex. 2018) ("[A]ssum[ing] that plaintiffs have satisfied each of the three Gingles prongs, the court still finds that they have failed to prove the ultimate question of vote dilution under § 2 because they have not proved that the minority group (i.e., Anglos) has the potential to elect a Republican, which plaintiffs maintain would be the Anglo candidate of choice.") (cleaned up).
The district court reached this conclusion, however, despite the fact that Perez was not decided until after the close of trial. I would remand to give the parties the opportunity to submit evidence under Perez.

The act of redrawing an electoral district is an inherently politicized matter. So courts naturally proceed with extreme caution before intervening—indeed, three members of the Supreme Court have suggested that courts should not decide vote dilution claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act at all. See Perez, 138 S. Ct. at 2335 (Thomas, J., joined by Gorsuch, J., concurring); Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 946, 114 S. Ct. 2581, 129 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1994) (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). The majority's reluctance to permit further proceedings on Plaintiffs' vote dilution claim is thus appropriate.
But Plaintiffs here have not had the opportunity to prove their case with full notice of the evidentiary standards that will govern their claim. I take no position on how their claim would be resolved on remand. But there is enough here to warrant further review under the new governing standard.1 
 For these reasons, I would remand for further proceedings on Plaintiffs' Section 2 vote dilution claim. I respectfully dissent in part.
