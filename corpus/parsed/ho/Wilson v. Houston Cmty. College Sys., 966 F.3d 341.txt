, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc:
Holding office in America is not for the faint of heart. With leadership comes criticism—whether from citizens of public spirit or personal malice, colleagues with conflicting visions or competing ambitions, or all of the above.
Those who seek office should not just expect criticism, but embrace it. Tough scrutiny is not a bug, but a defining feature of our constitutional structure. In America, we trust our citizens to determine for themselves what is right—and to count on vigorous, unrelenting debate to guide them. As Benjamin Franklin once wrote, "a free constitution and freedom of speech have such a reciprocal dependence on each other that they cannot subsist without consisting together." Benjamin Franklin, On Freedom of Speech and the Press, in 2 The Works of Benjamin Franklin 310 (Sparks ed., 1882).
Of course, no one enjoys being booed.1  But as de Tocqueville observed nearly two centuries ago, "[t]he social state naturally disposes Americans not to be easily offended in little things," and "the democratic freedom they enjoy makes this indulgence pass into the national mores." 2 Alexis De Tocqueville, Democracy In America 541 (Mansfield ed., 2000) (1840).
And because our citizens don't fear criticism, it is only natural to insist that officials don't either. We expect officials in every branch of government to rise to the challenge—not wilt under the pressure. Churchill once wrote: "Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities, because, as has been said, 'it is the quality which guarantees all others.'" Winston Churchill, Great Contemporaries 211 (Muller ed., 2012) (1937). Translation: Leaders lead. They listen to reason. But they won't be cowed by the mob.
No one would confuse the typical public officeholder today for Churchill. But whatever fortitude an official may happen to possess, we know this to be true: The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, not freedom from speech. It secures the right to criticize, not the right not to be criticized.
 The panel here took a different view, holding that public officials have a right not to be censured for engaging in speech critical of others.2  Our court has previously found such rights for judges. See Scott v. Flowers, 910 F.2d 201, 209 (5th Cir. 1990); but see id. at 215-16 (Garwood, J., dissenting); see also Jenevein v. Willing, 493 F.3d 551, 562 (5th Cir. 2007). So the panel understandably applied those precedents to officials outside the judiciary.
But our sister circuits have found no such right. See, e.g., Phelan v. Laramie Cty. Cmty. Coll. Bd., 235 F.3d 1243, 1248 (10th Cir. 2000) ("[C]ensure is clearly not a penalty that infringes Ms. Phelan's free speech rights.") (citing Zilich v. Longo, 34 F.3d 359, 364 (6th Cir. 1994)). As then-Judge Scalia once wrote, "[w]e know of no case in which the [F]irst [A]mendment has been held to be implicated by governmental action consisting of no more than governmental criticism of the speech's content." Block v. Meese, 793 F.2d 1303, 1313, 253 U.S. App. D.C. 317 (D.C. Cir. 1986). After all, the First Amendment does not "consider[] speakers to be so timid, or important ideas to be so fragile, that they are overwhelmed by knowledge of governmental disagreement." Id.
Leaders don't fear being booed. And they certainly don't sue when they are. I join Judge Jones's excellent opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.
