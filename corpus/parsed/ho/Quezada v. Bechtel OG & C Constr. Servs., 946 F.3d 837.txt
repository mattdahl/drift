The district court lacked jurisdiction to decide this case. So I would vacate the judgment and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. I respectfully dissent.

Arbitration agreements are contracts—and contracts are ordinarily a matter of state law. See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 67, 130 S. Ct. 2772, 177 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2010) ("[A]rbitration is a matter of contract."); Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.S. 662, 681, 130 S. Ct. 1758, 176 L. Ed. 2d 605 (2010) ("[T]he interpretation of an arbitration agreement is generally a matter of state law.").
Disputes arising out of arbitration thus belong in state court. Arbitration disputes may also be brought in federal court, if Congress so authorizes.
Arbitrations between diverse parties may of course be brought in federal court under the general diversity jurisdiction statute. 28 U.S.C. § 1332. For arbitration disputes between non-diverse parties, however, federal courts must point to statutory authority conferring jurisdiction over such matters.
The Supreme Court has held that the Federal Arbitration Act confers no federal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Hall Street Associates, LLC v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 581-82, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008) ("[The FAA is] something of an anomaly in the field of federal-court jurisdiction" in that it "bestow[s] no federal jurisdiction but rather require[es] an independent jurisdictional basis.") (quotations omitted).
Section 4 of the FAA, however, allows federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over certain arbitration disputes under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, the general federal question jurisdiction statute. Specifically, § 4 confers jurisdiction on federal courts over motions to compel arbitration, if the arbitration resolves federal questions. It does so by authorizing district courts to compel arbitration when federal jurisdiction would exist "save for [the arbitration agreement]." 9 U.S.C. § 4. In other words, a federal court may "look through" the arbitration agreement to determine if it could have exercised jurisdiction over the underlying controversy. Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556 U.S. 49, 53, 129 S. Ct. 1262, 173 L. Ed. 2d 206 (2009).
This case, however, involves not a motion to compel arbitration under § 4, but a motion to vacate an arbitration award under § 10. Sections 9-11 of the Federal Arbitration Act authorize motions to confirm, vacate, and modify arbitration awards. None of those sections contain the "look through" language found in § 4. Compare 9 U.S.C. § 4 ("A party . . . may petition any United States district court which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction . . .") (emphasis added), with §§ 9-11 (lacking any similar language).
Fidelity to text thus compels me to conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction in this case. Notably, neither the panel majority nor the parties claim any textual support for federal jurisdiction. Instead, they observe that there is a circuit split on the issue—and that under the "majority" view, the district court has jurisdiction despite the lack of textual support in §§ 9-11 of the FAA. I say "majority" view in quotes because it's only a 3-2 split—so it remains a "majority" view only because of our decision today. Compare McCormick v. America Online, Inc., 909 F.3d 677, 682 (4th Cir. 2018) (choosing to "look through"); Ortiz-Espinosa v. BBVA Sec. of P.R., Inc., 852 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2017) (same); and Doscher v. Sea Port Grp. Sec., LLC, 832 F.3d 372, 373 (2nd Cir. 2016) (same), with Magruder v. Fid. Brokerage Servs. LLC, 818 F.3d 285, 287-89 (7th Cir. 2016) (declining to "look through"); and Goldman v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts. Inc., 834 F.3d 242, 252-55 (3rd Cir. 2016) (same).
Rather than count circuits, I would follow the text wherever it leads. The panel majority responds that the text is absurd—that it makes no sense that Congress would confer federal jurisdiction over motions to compel under § 4, but not over motions to confirm, vacate, and modify under §§ 9-11. But there is nothing absurd about this dichotomy. Section 4 commences the arbitration process. Sections 9-11, by contrast, operate only after the issuance of the arbitration award. This difference between a motion to compel arbitration and one to confirm or change its outcome "parallels the distinction . . . between an original federal claim and a dispute about its contractual resolution." Goldman, 834 F.3d at 255 (quoting Magruder, 818 F.3d at 288).
This approach is also consistent with how we treat settlements. Magruder, 818 F.3d at 288. Like arbitration agreements, settlement agreements are matters of contract, designed to resolve disputes outside of the courtroom. The enforcement of settlements is ordinarily a matter for state courts, not federal courts—even when a settlement happens to resolve federal questions. See id. ("[I]f parties settle litigation that arose under federal law, any contest about that settlement needs an independent jurisdictional basis.") (citing Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 381-82, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 128 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1994)); see also, e.g., Hospitality House, Inc. v. Gilbert, 298 F.3d 424, 434 (5th Cir. 2002) (finding no jurisdiction in a dispute arising from a settlement of federal claims). There is no reason to treat arbitration differently.
The panel majority also warns that my reading would create perverse incentives. The majority worries that a careful litigant would "preserve federal jurisdiction" over a §§ 9-11 motion by first filing a motion to compel under § 4. But the majority cites no case law that would permit such a stratagem. See also Alford v. Dean Witter  Reynolds, Inc., 975 F.2d 1161, 1163 (5th Cir. 1992) (allowing dismissal of a case following a motion to compel). And if it is a problem, it is one that Congress can address.
Finally, the majority asserts that my approach would violate the "non-expansion rule" of the FAA, by giving § 4 a more expansive reading than §§ 9-11. The majority contends that such an expansive approach "has been rejected by the Supreme Court"—namely, Vaden. But Vaden instructs us to faithfully follow the text of the FAA, including the unique language of § 4. See 556 U.S. at 62 ("The text of § 4 drives our conclusion.").
I respectfully dissent.
