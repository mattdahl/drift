In Hainze v. Richards, 207 F.3d 795 (5th Cir. 2000), our court created a categorical "exigent circumstances" defense that appears nowhere in the text of either the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act.
So it is not surprising that every circuit to opine on this issue has to our knowledge rejected our approach. See, e.g., Gray v. Cummings, 917 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2019) (discussing Hainze and noting that "[o]ther circuits . . . have charted a different course, holding that Title II [of the ADA] applies without exception to ad hoc police encounters"); Sheehan v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 743 F.3d 1211, 1232 (9th Cir. 2014) ("We agree with the majority of circuits to have addressed the question that Title II applies to arrests."), rev'd on other grounds, 575 U.S. 600, 135 S. Ct. 1765, 191 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2015); Seremeth v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs Frederick County, 673 F.3d 333, 339 (4th Cir. 2012) ("[N]othing in the text of the ADA suggests that a separate exigent-circumstances inquiry is appropriate."); Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cty., 480 F.3d 1072, 1085 (11th Cir. 2007) (declining to follow Hainze).
Hainze is of course binding precedent, on us as much as on the district court. But our obligation to apply binding precedent faithfully does not require us to extend it where it doesn't belong. And as the majority explains, we need not apply Hainze where, as here, there is no threat of deadly harm to either the police officer or others.1 
Whatever risk of pain or injury S.W. may have presented here, a child with a jump rope would not appear to pose a "threat to human life." Hainze, 207 F.3d at 801. Accordingly, Hainze does not apply to this case.
That still leaves the question, however, whether S.W. has been denied a reasonable accommodation for his disability, in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.
It is difficult to imagine a reasonable justification for the officer's loss of temper and verbal abuse. Indeed, as the majority  notes, the officer was terminated from the police department as a result of this incident.
But the City of Southlake may fare better arguing that it is not "reasonable" to require school employees and police officers to risk pain or injury to themselves or others under the circumstances presented here. Although the facts presented do not rise to the "exigent circumstances" contemplated by Hainze, the risk of pain at issue here is certainly relevant to the reasonableness analysis. See, e.g., Sheehan, 743 F.3d at 1232 ("[E]xigent circumstances inform the reasonableness analysis under the ADA.") (citation omitted); Seremeth, 673 F.3d at 339 ("[T]he consideration of exigent circumstances is included in the determination of the reasonableness of the accommodation."); Bircoll, 480 F.3d at 1085 ("The exigent circumstances presented by criminal activity and the already onerous tasks of police on the scene go more to the reasonableness of the requested ADA modification.").
Also relevant to the analysis is whether a reasonable officer would have insisted on alternative measures to calm and secure the child, while minimizing the risk of pain or harm to himself or others, before resorting to handcuffs.
Whether S.W. was denied a reasonable accommodation for his disability under these circumstances has not yet been addressed by the district court in the first instance. Accordingly, I concur in the decision to vacate the judgment and remand this case for further proceedings.
