 in part and concurring in the judgment:
 [*P19]  This is an unusual case. It comes to us without any adversary briefing. The only briefs we have on appeal are the appellant's and the Guardian ad Litem's (submitted in support of the appellant's position). We have no opposing brief because the father chose to rest on the juvenile court's decision and did not submit a brief on appeal.
 [*P20]  With this in mind, I would decide this case on the narrowest possible ground, without addressing other issues not essential to our decision. The narrow ground is that the juvenile court dismissed the petition filed in this case sua sponte—without the benefit of any adversary briefing by the parties. That was error, as B.W.D. had both a statutory and a due process right to be heard before her petition was dismissed.
 [*P21]  The majority so concludes in its opinion. See supra ¶¶ 12-13. Yet it also proceeds to opine on other questions presented below and briefed (one-sidedly) on appeal. And on those issues the court purports to "reserve the right to reevaluate our conclusions in a future case in which we have the full benefit of the adversarial process." Supra ¶ 6 n.3.
 [*P22]  I agree with the impulse behind that reservation. But I think there is a better way to reserve our right to reconsider aspects of our opinion in a future case. In my view that is simply not to reach these other issues. I would take that course here. For that reason I concur only in the portions of the majority opinion that find error in the juvenile court's dismissal of B.W.D.'s petition without giving her the opportunity to be heard.
