 [*P37]  I concur in the judgment in this case on the basis of my opinion in Waite v. Utah Labor Commission, 2017 UT 86,     P.3d     (Lee, A.C.J., concurring in the judgment). As in Waite the petitioner in this case asserts an Open Courts Clause challenge to the legislature's enactment of a statute of repose that effectively cut of the availability of a cause of action previously available under the Workers' Compensation Act. For reasons stated in my opinion in Waite I would affirm on the ground that the Open Courts Clause does not limit the legislature's authority to prospectively alter the law giving rise to a legal right of action.
Justice Pearce, concurring:
 [*P38]  I concur and write separately for the same reasons outlined in my concurring opinion in Waite v. Utah Labor Commission,  2017 UT 86,     P.3d     (Pearce, J., concurring).
