 in part and concurring in the judgment:
 [*P28]  I concur in every element of the majority opinion except for footnote 4. That footnote, as the court concedes, "reache[s] out" to decide an issue "that we have found unpreserved." Supra ¶ 22 n.4. We are doing so, moreover, in a case in which we are reversing the court of appeals for improperly reaching an unpreserved issue.
 [*P29]  This strikes me as a double standard. We are an appellate court. And we are as subject to the law of preservation as is the court of appeals. We should heed the lessons of our own opinions. When we fail to do so we create the impression that we have confused the finality of our decisions with the infallibility of our decisionmaking.
 [*P30]  Our court does have power to "superintend the proper interpretation of the procedural rules." Supra ¶ 22 n.4. But our authority to do so is hardly unbounded. We "superintend" the rules through the proper exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Or by the promulgation or amendment of our rules of procedure. But not by dropping a footnote  resolving an issue that is not properly presented for our decision.
