dissenting in part, concurring in part, and concurring in the result):
For the reasons set forth in Judge Erdmann's separate opinion, I respectfully dissent from the portion of the majority opinion that holds that the convening authority in this case "dismissed" charges it expressly stated were "withdrawn." However, I nonetheless concur in the result.
First, I agree with the majority's conclusion that, pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 707(e), Appellant, by pleading guilty, waived any claim under R.C.M. 707.
Second, I agree with the majority's conclusion that any speedy trial claim under Article 10, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. ยง 810 (2000), was waived. See also United States v. Mizgala, 61 M.J. 122, 127 (C.A.A.F. 2005) (requiring a defendant to litigate an Article 10, UCMJ, claim prior to pleading guilty to avoid waiver).
Finally, I agree with the majority that Appellant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to litigate Article 10, UCMJ, at trial. However, as I agree with Judge Erdmann that the "withdrawal" of charges was a nullity, I would also address the granted issue -- whether Appellant's counsel was ineffective because he did not inform Appellant that a guilty plea waived appeal under R.C.M. 707.
I would resolve Appellant's ineffectiveness claim by addressing prejudice. See United States v. Perez, 64 M.J. 239, 243 (C.A.A.F. 2006). In order to prevail on an ineffectiveness claim an appellant must show that there is a reasonable probability that "absent [counsel's] error, there would have been a different result." United States v. Davis, 60 M.J. 469, 474 (C.A.A.F. 2005) (citation omitted). In this case, only dismissal with prejudice would have yielded a different result. To warrant dismissal with prejudice under R.C.M. 707 a defendant must satisfy, among other things, the Barker test. See R.C.M. 707(d)(1); Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530-33, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972).
Appellant has not shown the requisite prejudice to meet this high standard. During much of the delay period Appellant was released from active duty and at home. He has not shown an improper Government purpose for the delay. Nor has he proffered evidence of either oppressive pretrial incarceration or evidence that his "preparation for trial, defense evidence, trial strategy, or ability to present witnesses" were adversely impacted by the delay in this case. Mizgala, 61 M.J. at 129 (addressing the Barker factors). Because there was no material prejudice to Appellant's substantial rights under the facts of this case, I concur in the result.
ERDMANN, Judge (dissenting):
Because the convening authority's November 6, 2001, action did not dismiss the charges or stop the speedy trial clock, I respectfully dissent.
The Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) establish a unique system of justice. As a result, actions taken in the military justice system often have unique meanings and effects. "Dismissal" and "withdrawal" are terms of art, with distinct meanings under the Rules for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.). A commander may "dismiss" charges and thereby extinguish them. R.C.M. 401(c)(1). "Withdrawal", on the other hand, can occur  only after charges have been referred to a court-martial. R.C.M. 604(a). Withdrawal does not, however, extinguish the charges. The Government should be bound by the actual meaning of the terms it employs and I am not persuaded by subsequent arguments that we should construe those terms to mean something distinctly different and contrary to their ordinary meanings in the military justice system.
The staff judge advocate's November 2, 2001, memorandum to the convening authority specifically recommended in three separate sentences that the charges be "withdrawn." The convening authority specifically "concur[red]" with that recommendation. In addition, the initial charge sheet reflects that the charges were "withdrawn." Because none of these charges had been referred for trial by courts-martial, withdrawal was not possible. The purported withdrawal was a legal and factual nullity.
There is no evidence or manifestation of the convening authority's intent supporting any conclusion that these charges were dismissed. This court should not rewrite the procedural history of this case to come to that conclusion. The UCMJ and MCM establish rules and procedures as determined by the Congress and President, respectively. To the extent that those rules and our decisions demand procedural compliance from the defense, so too should we demand adherence to the rules by the Government. Withdrawal of these unreferred charges was a nullity that this court should not convert into a legal dismissal of the charges.
Turning to the speedy trial issue, I agree with the majority that Tippit's unconditional guilty pleas waived the Sixth Amendment and R.C.M. 707 speedy trial issues. However, in the context of this case and as framed by the parties at trial, I conclude that the issue of Tippit's right to a speedy trial under Article 10, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. ยง 810 (2000), was preserved for appellate review. See United States v. Mizgala, 61 M.J. 122, 127 (C.A.A.F. 2005). Although the defense's written speedy trial motion did not specifically rely upon Article 10, UCMJ, the Government obviously recognized the applicability of this fundamental right and argued in its written response that Article 10, UCMJ, had not been violated. In turn, the military judge recognized that the issue had been placed before him. He considered and ruled upon Tippit's right to a speedy trial under Article 10, UCMJ, and found that the Government had proceeded with reasonable diligence. Tippit subsequently appealed the Article 10, UCMJ, speedy trial issue to the Court of Criminal Appeals, which reviewed the Article 10, UCMJ, issue and affirmed the military judge's determination. In my view this constitutes litigation of the Article 10, UCMJ, speedy trial issue at trial and preserves the matter for appellate review. Mizgala, 61 M.J. at 127. Just as the Court of Criminal Appeals did, I would proceed to review Tippit's Article 10, UCMJ, claim.
Because the charges were never dismissed, the Government's accountability for speedy trial commenced on September 10, 2001, and October 10, 2001, when the charges in this case were preferred. That accountability continued uninterrupted up to the time of Tippit's trial -- an excessive delay of over one year. "[The] framework to determine whether the Government proceeded with reasonable diligence includes balancing the following four factors: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) whether the appellant made a demand for a speedy trial; and (4) prejudice to the appellant." Mizgala, 61 M.J. at 129 (citing Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972); United States v. Birge, 52 M.J. 209, 212 (C.A.A.F. 1999)).
Although there may have been some complexity involved in the forensic investigation of this case, I conclude that this delay was unjustified and well beyond that which can be considered reasonably necessary. Tippit demanded a speedy trial on August 20, 2001. During this period of delay, Tippit was restricted on June 15, 2001, released from active duty on November 6, 2001, recalled to active duty on June 5, 2002, and reported for duty two days later. Trial did not commence until November 21, 2002. This extended process strained Tippit's family relationships, disrupted his civilian affairs, and placed added  burdens upon his wife. The fact that Tippit was misadvised that the charges were dismissed, the uncertainty he experienced in his civilian life, and the disruption in his personal life constitute unusual anxiety that I find prejudicial. See id. (citing Barker, 407 U.S. at 532).
I would conclude that the Government failed to act with due diligence to bring Tippit to trial and that Tippit was prejudiced by the delay in violation of Article 10, UCMJ. Therefore, I would set aside the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals, set aside the findings and sentence, and dismiss the charges with prejudice. United States v. Kossman, 38 M.J. 258, 262 (C.M.A. 1993). Accordingly, I would not reach the ineffective assistance of counsel claim or the providence of Tippit's guilty pleas.
