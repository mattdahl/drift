Appellant abused his position of authority and likely should have been charged with the offense of maltreatment.1  He was not. But the answer to the Government's charging oversight is not for this Court to find the evidence of kidnapping legally sufficient.
Kidnapping is one of the most heinous offenses known to the law. Chatwin v. United States, 326 U.S. 455, 462, 66 S. Ct. 233, 90 L. Ed. 198 (1946); United States v. Picotte, 12 C.M.A. 196, 199, 30 C.M.R. 196, 199 (1961). Kidnapping, at common law, was defined as forceful abduction and was considered a felony. Picotte, 12 C.M.A. at 199, 30 C.M.R. at 199. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), it is punishable by life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Manual for Courts-Martial, United States pt. IV, para. 92.e. (2012 ed.) (MCM). The Court's decision today trivializes both the fear and force attendant to this serious offense and the horror faced by true kidnapping victims. In other words, it directly disregards the Supreme Court's direction in Chatwin, to guard against the "careless concept of the crime of kidnapping" and recognition that such a serious offense is not intended to punish "general transgressions of morality" that do not meet the statutory elements of kidnapping. 326 U.S. at 464. I respectfully dissent.
Kidnapping by inveiglement begins at the moment when the victim is "inveigled" or deceived by the accused, United States v. Macklin, 671 F.2d 60, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1982), and ends when a victim is no longer deceived or being held against his or her will. United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 281, 119 S. Ct. 1239, 143 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1999); United States v. Zuni, 273 F. App'x 733, 742 (10th Cir. 2008). Even the most casual peek at the actual facts of this case reveals that it is wholly distinguishable from the usual inveiglement case, where a victim is tricked into entering a vehicle driven by the accused or by an accomplice of the accused and solely controlled by the accused. See,  e.g., United States v. Blocker, 32 M.J. 281, 282-83 (C.M.A. 1991) (holding the evidence was sufficient to show kidnapping by inveiglement where the appellant lured the victim into his vehicle by telling her that he would take her home but instead drove the car into the woods where appellant forcibly raped the victim); see also United States v. Hoog, 504 F.2d 45, 50-51 (8th Cir. 1974) (evidence legally sufficient to show kidnapping by inveiglement where the appellant induced the respective victims into accepting a ride in his truck by false pretenses and to stay in the vehicle during its "roundabout course into Kansas" against their own will).
"'Against that person's will' means that the victim was held involuntarily." MCM pt. IV, para. 92.c.(3). And herein lies my primary disagreement with the majority. Involuntariness is the fundamental essence of the crime of kidnapping. Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 464. The involuntary nature of the detention may result from either physical or non-physical restraint, i.e., "force, mental or physical coercion, or from other means including, false representations." MCM pt. IV, para. 92.c.(3); see also Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 460 ("[t]he act of holding a kidnapped person for a proscribed purpose necessarily implies an unlawful physical or mental restraint for an appreciable period against the person's will and with a willful intent so to confine the victim"). Notably, "[e]vidence of the availability or nonavailability to the victim of means of exit or escape is relevant to the voluntariness of the detention, as is evidence of threats or force, or lack thereof, by the accused to detain the victim." MCM pt. IV, para. 92.c.(3).
Here, there is zero evidence that PV2 AM was held against her will. Rather, Appellant and PV2 AM were in a taxi, a commercial vehicle for hire being driven by a third-party with no ties to either PV2 AM or Appellant. As recognized by the President's definition of "[a]gainst the will," the availability of an exit or escape is relevant to the voluntariness of the detention. PV2 AM, a passenger in a taxi, was able to indicate to the taxi driver that she wanted to be taken somewhere else, i.e., "availability [of an] exit." Indeed, PV2 AM testified at trial that she heard Appellant give his own address to the cab driver and correctly interpreted it as his address and not her own. PV2 AM, well aware of where the taxi was directed to go, was free to either get out of the taxi or to change the destination at any point during the taxi ride. See Macklin, 671 F.2d at 66-67 (concluding that even if there was legally sufficient evidence of inveiglement, that there was no evidence whatsoever that the two children were "held" against their will when they were "free to come and go as they pleased, to speak to other people, and to leave appellant at any time they wished").
In addition to no evidence that the putative "kidnapping" victim, PV2 AM, was actually unable to redirect or leave the cab, neither is there any evidence of either an actual threat of physical harm to her or fear on her part of physical harm that overbore her will, as the law requires in every other instance. See, e.g., Article 120, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 920 (2012); Article 122, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 922 (2012); United States v. Kaplansky, 42 F.3d 320, 324 (6th Cir. 1994) (recognizing that "the potential for violence against the victim is an inherent aspect of the crime of kidnapping"). Rather, the "mental coercion" the majority deems legally sufficient to make her unable to redirect the cab is fear of getting in trouble for underage drinking. Yet, even that fear somehow dissipated so as to render her "unkidnapped" once she exited the cab, perhaps to explain her waiting patiently and unattended while Appellant checked to make sure "the coast was clear" so they could have sex undetected by his roommate. Why this freedom was not similarly constrained by her "fear," or concern about her career, is entirely unclear.
Whatever level of mental coercion is sufficient, the fear of getting into trouble is not sufficient "fear" to constitute mental restraint for this serious felony. In contradistinction, in United States v. Wesson, the court upheld a kidnapping conviction where the victim was restrained by fear. 779 F.2d 1443 (9th Cir. 1986) (per curiam). In Wesson, appellant, a truck driver, took a young girl on a ride in his truck and brutally beat and raped her. Id. at 1444. Even though there was no indication that the girl was physically  restrained in the truck, the court found that she continued on the journey despite being raped and beaten because she was terrified of the consequences if caught trying to escape. Id. Wesson is clearly distinguishable from the instant case.
While the threshold for legal sufficiency is low, it should not be so low as to conclude that someone was held against their will when they were in a commercial vehicle over which they had equal control, knew where they were actually going, had no fear of physical harm whatsoever, and then stayed overnight having sex with the putative kidnapper. Today's ruling is contrary to the precedent of the Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeals that have considered the issue, and our own Court. Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 462; Zuni, 273 F. App'x at 737-38; Wesson, 779 F.2d at 1443-44; Macklin, 671 F.2d at 66-67; Hoog, 504 F.2d at 50-51; Blocker, 32 M.J. at 282-83.
In the current climate, where it appears that neither the convening authorities nor the lower courts are immune from external pressures, see, e.g., United States v. Barry, Dkt. No. 17-0162, Finding and Facts of Conclusion from DuBay Hr'g 6 (C.A.A.F. 2017) (finding "external pressures on the military justice system"); United States v. Riesbeck,     M.J.     (1, 5) (C.A.A.F. 2018); United States v. Boyce, 76 M.J. 242, 251 (C.A.A.F. 2017), this Court has a heightened responsibility to ensure that servicemembers receive fair and impartial justice, instead of a "rough form of justice." United States v. Denedo, 556 U.S. 904, 918, 129 S. Ct. 2213, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1235 (2009) (Roberts, C.J., joined by Scalia, J., Thomas, J., and Alito, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Rather than being complicit in saving the Government from its charging oversight, and diluting the concept of "mental coercion" to the degree that the majority has done to salvage a conviction, we should do as we did in United States v. Bright, 66 M.J. 359 (C.A.A.F. 2008), and call this charge and specification legally insufficient, as it surely is.
