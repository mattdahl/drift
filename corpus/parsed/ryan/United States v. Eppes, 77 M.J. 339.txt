 in part and concurring in the result.
I join fully in the majority decision that there was probable cause to issue the December 7, 2012, warrant to search Appellant's home. With respect to the Court's resolution of the search of Appellant's bags on February 5, 2013, I respectfully concur in the result. To my mind, the better way to resolve that issue1  is to ask whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below, United States v. Keefauver, 74 M.J. 230, 233 (C.A.A.F. 2015), the military judge abused his discretion in denying the motion to suppress the evidence from that search. Id. That decision, in turn, depends on whether he was wrong to determine that law enforcement's commonsense, non-hypertechnical interpretation of the warrant's scope was reasonable. That is a factual thumb on the scale in the Government's favor, on top of two layers of deferential review. Under the facts of this case, I therefore conclude that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to suppress evidence found inside bags in Appellant's immediate vicinity, as the military magistrate's search authorization could reasonably be read to include a search of Appellant's bags.
The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const. amend. IV. It is axiomatic that a warrantless search and seizure is "presumptively unreasonable," Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 559, 124 S. Ct. 1284, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1068 (2004) (quoting Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586, 100 S. Ct. 1371, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1980)); United States v. Gurczynski, 76 M.J. 381, 386 (C.A.A.F. 2017), and that a search conducted pursuant to a valid warrant is presumptively reasonable. Gurczynski, 76 M.J. at 386; United States v. Wicks, 73 M.J. 93, 99 (C.A.A.F. 2014). The Fourth Amendment, in  turn, requires that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." U.S. Const. amend. IV.
In this case there is a warrant and, with respect to the February 5 search, no one argues either that probable cause was lacking to search Appellant's bags or that the things seized as a result of that search were outside the scope of the warrant. Appellant argues instead that law enforcement exceeded the scope of the warrant to search his person by searching the bags in his immediate vicinity at the time of the search. Brief for Appellant at 10-11, United States v. Eppes, No. 17-0364 (C.A.A.F. Jul. 12, 2017) (citations omitted). The military judge simply did not abuse his discretion in coming to the contrary conclusion as his decision was not outside the "range of choices reasonably arising from the applicable facts and the law." United States v. Irizarry, 72 M.J. 100, 103 (C.A.A.F. 2013) (quoting United States v. Miller, 66 M.J. 306, 307 (C.A.A.F. 2008)).2 
The affidavit accompanying the warrant requested search authorization "for a search of EPPES' person, his personal belongings that may be located within a reasonable vicinity of EPPES' person or as may be found at his work location located in Chapel 1, and his vehicle." The warrant itself authorized a search of the "person of . . . EPPES," "premises known as" his vehicle, and the seizure of "[d]ocuments and/or items of evidence as may be used in the commission of fraud against the United States Government or against federally insured financial institutions; watches and jewelry matching the description of items claimed lost or stolen in insurance claims against USAA and commercial airline companies."
In his ruling on the defense motion to suppress the evidence found in the "closet-sized office" in Eppes's immediate vicinity, the military judge concluded, inter alia, that "the agents were authorized to search the person of Capt Eppes and reasonably searched the area immediately around him." Utilizing a commonsense rather than a hypertechnical review of the warrant, United States v. Srivastava, 540 F.3d 277, 289-90 (4th Cir. 2008); United States v. Stiver, 9 F.3d 298, 302-03 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1136, 114 S. Ct. 1115, 127 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1994); United States v. Marques, 600 F.2d 742, 751-52 (9th Cir. 1979); United States v. Salameh, 54 F. Supp. 2d 236, 277-78 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), law enforcement could reasonably conclude that the "person" mentioned in the warrant included bags in close proximity to the "person." There is nothing constitutionally unreasonable about that conclusion. Gurczynski, 76 M.J. at 386 ("[T]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is 'reasonableness.'" (quoting Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452, 459, 131 S. Ct. 1849, 179 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2011))); cf. Groh, 540 U.S. at 572-80 (Thomas, J., dissenting).
First, there is no evidence that the warrant failed to include the apparently talismanic words "his personal belongings that may be located within a reasonable vicinity of EPPES' person" because the magistrate believed there was no probable cause to believe the evidence he authorized to be seized would be found in his personal bags. Indeed, such evidence as there is suggests that the same person who provided the affidavit in support of the warrant also filled out the warrant's form, supporting the opposite conclusion: that both the affiant and the magistrate believed the "person" of EPPES included within in its scope the subordinate clause "his personal belongings that may be located within a reasonable vicinity of EPPES' person." This interpretation of the facts is all the more reasonable given that the list of items to be seized included documents and numerous watches, which are unlikely to be found in someone's pockets. United States v. Graham, 638 F.2d 1111, 1112-14 (7th Cir. 1981).
 Second, it is folly to forget that in executing a warrant law enforcement is required to exercise judgment, making commonsense, rather than hypertechnical, determinations about the scope of their authority, while precluded from "general rummaging about." Gurczynski, 76 M.J. at 386; Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 485, 85 S. Ct. 506, 13 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1965)); United States v. Fogg, 52 M.J. 144, 148 (C.A.A.F. 1999). Of course, this ability to exercise discretion does not give law enforcement a "blank check," Hessel v. O'Hearn, 977 F.2d 299, 302 (7th Cir. 1992), and "[f]lagrant disregard for the terms of the warrant" is forbidden. Id. But law enforcement's reasonable interpretation of a warrant's terms should be respected. See, e.g., id. (Law enforcement is "not obliged to interpret [warrants] narrowly, and would . . . be mistaken to do so . . . ."); Srivastava, 540 F.3d at 289-90 (holding that personal tax documents were included in a commonsense understanding of a warrant authorizing the seizure of documents of a pass-through tax entity); Stiver, 9 F.3d at 302-03 (holding that officers had a reasonable basis to answer accused's telephone when executing a warrant for "drug paraphernalia," because the telephone could be considered "paraphernalia"); Marques, 600 F.2d at 751-52 (holding that a science text-book including a methamphetamine recipe was reasonably within the scope of a warrant authorizing the seizure of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia when the affidavit in the warrant application makes clear that the police expected to find evidence of methamphetamine production); Salameh, 54 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (emphasizing that law enforcement interpretation of search warrants should be "commonsensical" not "hyper-technical" (quoting Johnson v. Massey, No. 3:92 CV 178 (JAC), 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13100, at *13, 1993 WL 372263, at *4 (D. Conn. Sept. 17, 1993))).
There was no rummaging about here, and it was constitutionally reasonable for the law enforcement officers to conclude that a search of the Appellant's person referred to more than the literal person of the Appellant and reasonably included bags in his immediate vicinity. Humans are not kangaroos, and the human body thus does not have natural "pockets" or "pouches" in which to store either watch and jewelry collections or documents related to insurance and travel fraud. Graham, 638 F.2d at 1112-14. "To hold differently would be to narrow the scope of a search of one's person to a point at which it would have little meaning." Id. at 1114.
