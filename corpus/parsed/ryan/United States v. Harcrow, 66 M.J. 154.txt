I concur with the majority opinion, but write separately on two small points.
First, Appellant is entitled to avail himself of the plain error doctrine here only because Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), announced a "new rule" while his case was on direct review -- not because the military judge in this case did anything wrong. See Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 127 S. Ct. 1173, 1180-81, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2007) (describing Crawford as creating a new, non-watershed, rule); United States v. Ziskind, 491 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2007) (applying the  plain error standard on direct review to a case tried before Crawford was decided); Thomas v. United States, 914 A.2d 1, 20 (D.C. 2006) (applying Crawford retroactively using the plain error standard to a case on direct review).
This case illustrates the curious outcome flowing from the confluence of the retroactivity rule and the plain error doctrine. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 322-23, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1987); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993). Such a posture requires us to accept, and act upon, three fictions: (1) that Crawford had been decided at the time of Appellant's trial; (2) that, had Appellant's trial counsel known about Crawford, he would not have forfeited his objection to the lab reports; and (3) that the military judge would have, despite Crawford, erroneously allowed the reports to be admitted. 1  See United States v. Harcrow, 66 M.J. 154 (6-7), 2008 CAAF LEXIS 320 (C.A.A.F. 2008). It is apparent that it is at least a misnomer to suggest that the military judge committed error at trial here. And it remains the case that a military judge is not required to probe, inquire, or otherwise do anything when there is a lack of objection to evidence that might be objected to. See, e.g., Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 690 n.7, 108 S. Ct. 1496, 99 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1988) (noting that it is not the duty of the trial judge to sua sponte prevent the admission of objectionable evidence). 
Second, evidence that qualifies under Military Rule of Evidence 803(6)'s business record exception is nontestimonial evidence. Crawford, 541 U.S. at 56 (noting that business records "by their nature [are] not testimonial"); see also id. at 76 (Rehnquist, C.J., joined by O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting with approval the majority's exclusion of business records from the definition of testimonial evidence); United States v. Magyari, 63 M.J. 123, 127 (C.A.A.F. 2006) (concluding that laboratory evidence was admissible because it was not made in anticipation of litigation and was a "record of 'regularly conducted' activity"); United States v. Washington, 498 F.3d 225, 229 (4th Cir. 2007) (admitting laboratory reports over a Confrontation Clause challenge); United States v. Ellis, 460 F.3d 920, 924 (7th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that statements embodied in business records are nontestimonial); United States v. Baker, 458 F.3d 513, 519 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that "business records are nontestimonial and therefore do not implicate the Confrontation Clause concerns of Crawford"); United States v. Hagege, 437 F.3d 943, 958 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding "[b]usiness records fall outside the core class of 'testimonial evidence,' and thus are not subject to the absolute requirement of confrontation established in Crawford").
But evidence is not admissible as a business record if it is made in anticipation of litigation. Compare United States v. Feliz, 467 F.3d 227, 236 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that an autopsy report was admissible as a business record because it was not made in anticipation of litigation), and United States v. Bahena-Cardenas, 411 F.3d 1067, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding "that [a] warrant of deportation is nontestimonial because it was not made in anticipation of litigation, and because it is simply a routine, objective, cataloging of an unambiguous factual matter"), with Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 113, 63 S. Ct. 477, 87 L. Ed. 645 (1943) (holding that an accident report prepared by a railroad did not qualify as business record because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation); United States v. Blackburn, 992 F.2d 666, 670 (7th Cir. 1993) (holding that a report was inadmissible because it "was not kept in the course of a regularly conducted business  activity, but rather was specially prepared at the behest of the FBI and with the knowledge that any information it supplied would be used in an ongoing criminal investigation"), and United States v. Stone, 604 F.2d 922, 925-26 (5th Cir. 1979) (holding that an affidavit prepared by a United States Treasury Department official was inadmissible because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation).
In this case, the laboratory reports were made by laboratory technicians who almost certainly knew: (1) the reports were being prepared at the request of law enforcement; (2) the evidence was gathered during an arrest; and (3) the reports were being generated in anticipation of a specific prosecution. See Harcrow, 66 M.J. 154 (12-13), 2008 CAAF LEXIS 323. On these facts there remains a question in my mind as to whether the reports were admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule either before or after Crawford.
STUCKY, Judge, with whom EFFRON, Chief Judge, joins (concurring in the result):
I concur in the result, but write separately to emphasize that any error in the admission of the laboratory reports, if error at all, cannot be plain error because the state of the law at issue here was (until today) thoroughly unsettled.
This case was tried in 2002, under the Confrontation Clause regime of Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), where the sine qua non was whether the out-of-court statement bore "adequate indicia of reliability -- i.e., falls within a 'firmly rooted hearsay exception' or bears 'particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.'" Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 42, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004) (quoting Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66). Laboratory reports were normally admissible as business records under Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 803(6), a firmly rooted hearsay exception. See United States v. Rankin, 64 M.J. 348, 353 (C.A.A.F. 2007); United States v. Magyari, 63 M.J. 123, 128 (C.A.A.F. 2006).
While direct appeal in this case was underway, the Supreme Court overruled Ohio v. Roberts and established a new rule in which the "testimonial" or "nontestimonial" nature of the out-of-court statement determined whether the Confrontation Clause affected its admissibility under the Sixth Amendment. Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51. While the Supreme Court later held Crawford not to apply retroactively to judgments in criminal cases that were already final on direct review, see Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 127 S. Ct. 1173, 1181-84, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2007), the holding in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 322-23, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1987), requires its application to cases, like this one, that were on direct appeal at the time of the decision.
Error is "plain" when it is "obvious" or "clear under current law." United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993). Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 117 S. Ct. 1544, 137 L. Ed. 2d 718 (1997), held that "plain error" is to be judged as of the time of appellate consideration, taking into account changes in the law since the trial. Id. at 467-68.
This case is not Johnson, however. In Johnson, the law at the time of trial was clear, but was later changed by an opinion of the Supreme Court such that it was once again clear, but contrary, at the time of appellate consideration. Id. at 467-68. Here, the law was clear at the time of trial -- Ohio v. Roberts -- but the Supreme Court's decision in Crawford has thrown it into doubt rather than either confirming it or clearly changing it.
Where the law was unsettled at the time of trial and remained unclear at the time of appeal, a decision by a trial court cannot be plain error. 28 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice, ยง 652.04[3], at 652-22 n.34 (3d ed. 2007) (citing cases from eleven of the twelve federal circuits). It would seem to follow, then, that where the court correctly applied existing law at trial, but the law subsequently became unsettled and was unsettled when the case was on appeal, there could be no plain error.
That the law on the admissibility of laboratory reports was thrown into flux by Crawford  is undeniable. Compare United States v. Ellis, 460 F.3d 920, 923-27 (7th Cir. 2006), People v. Geier, 41 Cal. 4th 555, 61 Cal. Rptr. 3d 580, 161 P.3d 104, 133-40 (Cal. 2007), State v. O'Maley, 156 N.H. 125, 932 A.2d 1, 9-15 (N.H. 2007), State v. Forte, 360 N.C. 427, 629 S.E.2d 137, 142-45 (N.C. 2006), Commonwealth v. Verde, 444 Mass. 279, 827 N.E.2d 701, 705-06 (Mass. 2005), State v. Dedman, 2004 NMSC 37, PP 24-32, 136 N.M. 561, 102 P.3d 628, People v. Meekins, 34 A.D.3d 843, 828 N.Y.S.2d 83, 85 (N.Y. App. Div. 2006), Pruitt v. State, 954 So. 2d 611, 615-17 (Ala. Crim. App. 2006) (all holding lab reports are nontestimonial), with Hinojos-Mendoza v. People, 169 P.3d 662, 667 (Colo. 2007), State v. March, 216 S.W.3d 663, 665-67 (Mo. 2007), Thomas v. United States, 914 A.2d 1, 5 (D.C. 2006), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 241, 169 L. Ed. 2d 160 (2007), City of Las Vegas v. Walsh, 121 Nev. 899, 124 P.3d 203, 208 (Nev. 2005), State v. Laturner, 38 Kan. App. 2d 193, 163 P.3d 367, 376 (Kan. Ct. App. 2007), State v. Moss, 215 Ariz. 385, 160 P.3d 1143, 1148-49 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2007), State v. Smith, 2006-Ohio-1661, P 16 (Ohio Ct. App. 2006), Johnson v. State, 929 So. 2d 4, 7 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005) (all holding lab reports are testimonial). A certiorari petition raising the question is presently before the Supreme Court. Commonwealth v. Melendez-Diaz, 69 Mass. App. Ct. 1114, 870 N.E.2d 676 (Mass. Ct. App. 2007), petition for cert. filed, 76 U.S.L.W. 3255 (U.S. Oct. 26, 2007) (No. 07-591) [decision now reported at: 128 S. Ct. 1647, 170 L. Ed. 2d 352].
The majority relies on dictum in Magyari as the basis for concluding that the error was plain. I do not find that dictum persuasive authority for such a holding. As neither the Supreme Court nor this Court (until today) had resolved the admissibility of such criminal laboratory reports under Crawford, and other courts are split on the issue, there can be no plain error. See United States v. Springer, 165 F. App'x 709, 715 (11th Cir. 2006).
