I concur with the majority's opinion in full. I write separately only to express my skepticism that an accused may permissibly appeal an adverse ruling of a Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) where the case came before the CCA as an interlocutory appeal by the government under Article 62, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 862. I fully recognize that this Court has long considered petitions in this posture without question, even rarely granting and deciding cases in favor of the accused. See, e.g., United States v. Mangahas, 77 M.J. 220 (C.A.A.F. 2018). Nevertheless, this practice runs contrary to the well-established principles guiding criminal appeals.
It is a bedrock principle of appellate procedure that piecemeal appellate litigation should be avoided. See Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 324-25, 60 S. Ct. 540, 84 L. Ed. 783 (1940). This policy against permitting interlocutory appeals is "especially compelling" in criminal cases. Id. at 325; see DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 124, 82 S. Ct. 654, 7 L. Ed. 2d 614 (1962) ("Th[e] insistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-footed administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases."). We should therefore be hesitant to extend the purview of interlocutory appeals under Article 62, UCMJ, absent compelling justification.
Looking first to the text of Article 62, UCMJ, I see no hint that it provides any right to an accused. Indeed, the article's title states quite clearly what it provides: "Appeal by the United States." There is no mention of criminal defendants, nor, for that matter, is there any mention of this Court. Article 62, UCMJ. While the general question whether this Court may entertain an appeal of an Article 62, UCMJ, ruling by a CCA was answered in United States v. Lopez de Victoria, 66 M.J. 67, 68-71 (C.A.A.F. 2008); see United States v. Michael, 66 M.J. 78, 81-82 (C.A.A.F. 2008) (Ryan, J., with whom Erdmann, J., joined, concurring in part and in the result), we have never addressed head on the question whether we can or should utilize that logic to offer an avenue for an accused to appeal an adverse Article 62, UCMJ, CCA ruling to this Court.1 
The truncated nature of government appeals in criminal cases under Article 62, UCMJ, may justify our review of a CCA decision adverse to the Government. Unlike the accused, the Government's ability to appeal in criminal cases is historically disfavored and exists only by statute. DiBella, 369 U.S. at 130; Carroll v. United States, 354 U.S. 394, 400-01, 77 S. Ct. 1332, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1442 (1957). Working from this baseline, Congress saw fit to enable certain government appeals in criminal cases in the military justice system. Article 62, UCMJ.
Article 62, UCMJ, entitled "Appeal by the United States," provides the government the right to appeal certain rulings and orders of a military judge. Article 62(a)(1), UCMJ. These appeals, by necessity, arise prior to any conviction and sentence and are interlocutory in nature because of limitations rightfully placed on government appeals of acquittals by the Double Jeopardy Clause—preventing an accused from being tried twice for the same offense. See United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 339-51, 95 S. Ct. 1013, 43 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1975). In truth, an errant order at the trial level suppressing a key piece of evidence or dismissing a charge or indictment can equate to finality by preventing the government from prosecuting a case to a verdict. See, e.g., United States v. Watson, 386 F.3d 304, 308 (1st Cir. 2004). And if the CCA upholds a decision against the government on appeal under Article 62, UCMJ, that decision would forever evade review at this Court unless the government may appeal again. In contrast, an accused faced with an unfavorable decision at the CCA is expressly permitted to appeal that decision in the ordinary course of appellate review if he is convicted. Article 66(b)(1)(B), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 866(b)(1)(B).  There is no reason Article 62, UCMJ, must or should be read to give an accused the opportunity to appeal.
Further, I see no support for permitting an accused's interlocutory appeal based on the practice of Article III courts. Article 62, UCMJ, was modeled after 18 U.S.C. § 3731, Lopez de Victoria, 66 M.J. at 70, which permits government appeals in federal civilian criminal cases to the circuit courts of appeal.2  18 U.S.C. § 3731. When applying this statute or discussing criminal appeals generally, the Article III courts evince no understanding that statutes permitting interlocutory appeals by the government upset the long-standing presumption that criminal defendants may not appeal on an interlocutory basis. See Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 270, 104 S. Ct. 1051, 79 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1984) ("Nothing about a disqualification order distinguishes it from the run of pretrial judicial decisions that affect the rights of criminal defendants yet must await completion of trial-court proceedings for review."); United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 U.S. 263, 270, 102 S. Ct. 3081, 73 L. Ed. 2d 754 (1982) ("The right asserted by respondents is simply not one that must be upheld prior to trial if it is to be enjoyed at all."); Cobbledick, 309 U.S. at 325-26 ("The correctness of a trial court's rejection even of a constitutional claim made by the accused in the process of prosecution must await his conviction before its reconsideration by an appellate tribunal."); United States v. Clariot, 655 F.3d 550, 552 (6th Cir. 2011) ("Section 3731 provides a one-party path for interlocutory review of suppression orders. It allows the government, but not criminal defendants, to challenge a suppression ruling prior to trial."); United States v. Williams, 413 F.3d 347, 354 (3d Cir. 2005) ("Although an order granting suppression of evidence is not considered a final order, the United States is specifically permitted by 18 U.S.C. § 3731 to bring an interlocutory appeal. Section 3731 affords no such right to criminal defendants."); United States v. Eggert, 624 F.2d 973, 975-76 (10th Cir. 1980) ("[P]etitioner's contentions can be fully reviewed by this court on direct appeal in the event of a conviction. . . . [W]e do not believe that the due process violation alleged in this case . . . is the kind that justifies a departure from the general rule of non-appealability of prejudgment motions."). And in those cases where the government does appeal under 18 U.S.C. § 3731, there is no clear avenue to the Supreme Court for a defendant confronted with an adverse ruling. See Wilson, 420 U.S. at 353 (stating that a ruling in favor of an accused appealed by the government under 18 U.S.C. § 3731, "could be acted on by the Court of Appeals or indeed [the Supreme Court] without subjecting him to a second trial at the Government's behest" but that if the government prevails on appeal, "the case must go back to the District Court").
Article 62, UCMJ, like 18 U.S.C. § 3731, recognizes the government's limited ability to appeal and represents a legislative policy designed to carve out specific exceptions allowing the government to appeal decisions that would be otherwise unreviewable. The government may only appeal when a decision or order at the trial level falls under the strict requirements specified by Congress. See Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 656, 97 S. Ct. 2034, 52 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1977) ("The right of appeal . . . in criminal cases, is purely a creature of statute; in order to exercise that statutory right of appeal one must come within the terms of the applicable statute."); United States v. Wuterich, 67 M.J. 63, 72 (C.A.A.F. 2008) (stating that this Court does not liberally construe Article 62, UCMJ). Thus, we should be wary of permitting this same statute to be used by criminal defendants as an end run around the general prohibition on interlocutory appeals. See DiBella 369 U.S. at 124; United States v. Hanks, 24 F.3d 1235, 1239 (10th Cir. 1994) ("[Defendant] can not piggyback on the government's appeal. [Defendant's]  appeal cannot stand on its own because the denial of a motion to suppress evidence is not immediately appealable."). Doing so would serve only to further delay and interrupt the proceedings below without adequate justification.
This case is a perfect example of needless delay and interruption. There is no colorable claim that Appellant was entitled to relief, as the CCA clearly explained. We nonetheless interrupted the trial—at which Appellant may still yet be acquitted—for an additional period of time only to conclude that the CCA was precisely correct. In my view, we should only depart from the baseline principle disfavoring interlocutory appeals "when observance of it would practically defeat the right to any review at all." Cobbledick, 309 U.S. at 324-25. This is the purpose for the statutes authorizing government appeal under those circumstances. Article 62, UCMJ; 18 U.S.C. § 3731. In contrast, defendants may always seek appellate review if and when they are convicted, see Article 66(b)(1)(B), UCMJ, and there is no clear statutory authorization allowing criminal defendants to appeal on an interlocutory basis.
In this case, whether Appellant had the ability to appeal the CCA's decision and whether permitting this practice is workable was not raised or briefed, but I believe this Court should give this issue full consideration if and when it is presented in an appropriate case.
