I concur in the careful opinion of the Court based on the standard of review; the military judge applied the correct law and did not clearly err in his findings of fact. United States v. Sullivan, 42 M.J. 360, 363 (C.A.A.F. 1995); United States v. Hollis, 57 M.J. 74, 79 (C.A.A.F. 2002). I would hold similarly if the military judge had come to the opposite conclusion and ruled that the statements in  question did not fall under the medical exception to the hearsay rule. In my view the facts presented by this case are at the very banks of the legal shore envisioned by the language and purpose of Military Rule of Evidence 803(4) as it has evolved through case law.
