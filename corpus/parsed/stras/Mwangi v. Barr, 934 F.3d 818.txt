, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
The Board did not abuse its discretion when it declined to stretch the 90-day deadline for seeking reopening to nearly a year and a half, as the court correctly holds. See Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 866 (8th Cir. 2006) (explaining that equitable tolling "is not available to those who sleep on their rights"). But because this holding fully resolves the dispute over whether the Board properly denied Mwangi's motion to reopen, there is no reason to address whether Mwangi would have otherwise been allowed to reopen the proceedings based on the alleged misdeeds of counsel. Accordingly, I concur and join all but Part (2) of the court's opinion.
