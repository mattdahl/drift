, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I join all but Part II.B. of the court's opinion. The court's analysis on the attorney-fees issue is a reach. To have enough to go on for "meaningful appellate review," we need findings. H & R Block Tax Servs. LLC v. Acevedo-Lopez, 742 F.3d 1074, 1078 (8th Cir. 2014). Here, there are almost none. For example, although the district court alludes to Safeway Transit's "own bad acts," it does not tell us what they were. See IPSCO Tubulars, Inc. v. Ajax TOCCO Magnathermic Corp., 779 F.3d 744, 751-52 (8th Cir. 2015) (remanding with instructions to "enter findings of fact and conclusions of law that enable this court to review [the district court's] decision"). It does even less with Safeway Transit's allegations of bad-faith litigation conduct. It ignores them. But that is fine, the court says, because it must have considered each of the issues that Safeway Transit briefed, whether they were mentioned or not. Cf. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 416, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1975) (emphasizing that discretionary decisions are not "shielded from thorough appellate review"). I would not give the district court credit for work that it did not do. See Cody v. Hillard, 139 F.3d 1197, 1199-1200 (8th Cir. 1998) (remanding because it was unclear whether the district court "ignored the evidence" or just "considered [it] inconsequential"). With so many question marks, I would remand for findings.
