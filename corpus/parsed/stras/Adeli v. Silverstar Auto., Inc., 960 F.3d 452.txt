Due process is a creature that takes on many forms. It has long provided basic procedural protections like notice and an opportunity to be heard. See Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950); 3 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, § 1783, at 661 (Boston, Hilliard, Gray, & Co. 1833) (explaining that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause "affirms the right of trial according to the process and proceedings of the common law"). It has morphed over time though. Today, we are asked to determine how far to go in protecting civil defendants from bad outcomes that arise out of perfectly good procedures.
Perhaps we should call this whole exercise "anti-due process." See 1 John Bouvier, A Law Dictionary, Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States of America, and of the Several States of the American Union (Daniel A. Gleason ed., George W. Childs 14th ed. 1871) (defining "due process of law," at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, as "[l]aw in its regular course of administration through courts of justice").7  After the jury hears the evidence, listens to the arguments of counsel, receives instructions from the judge, and then talks behind closed doors, it renders a verdict about how much a defendant like Silverstar should have to pay for its reprehensible conduct. See BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 600, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (discussing the jury's role—as the "voice of the community"—in "assess[ing] . . . the measure of punishment the defendant deserved"); see also Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 564-65, 6 S. Ct. 501, 29 L. Ed. 729 (1886) (explaining the jury's role in awarding  damages around the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption). But then, as judges, we must undo the jury's award if we find it "grossly excessive," using a collection of malleable "guideposts," often on nothing more than a cold record and a few briefs. Gore, 517 U.S. at 562, 574 (majority opinion) (citation omitted); see also May v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, 852 F.3d 806, 816 (8th Cir. 2017) (asking whether the award "shocks the conscience"). All in the name of due process.
The results, unsurprisingly, can be arbitrary, and this case is a good example. See Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 434, 121 S. Ct. 1678, 149 L. Ed. 2d 674 (2001) (describing the "constitutional line" as "inherently imprecise" (citation omitted)). In this circuit, on the happenstance of having seen a case like this one before, we can affirm a 24.75:1 punitive-damages-to-actual-damages ratio. See Grabinski v. Blue Springs Ford Sales, Inc., 203 F.3d 1024, 1025-26 (8th Cir. 2000). But if Silverstar had fraudulently sold Adeli something other than a used car, the plaintiffs may well have been stuck with a single-digit ratio. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 425, 123 S. Ct. 1513, 155 L. Ed. 2d 585 (2003); Ondrisek v. Hoffman, 698 F.3d 1020, 1031-32 (8th Cir. 2012) (collecting cases); see also ante at 15-16 (explaining that prior cases can provide notice that a large award is possible).
In fact, even within the single digits, the due-process scalpel is blunt: if we determine that a defendant has acted reprehensibly but not too reprehensibly, the parties simply have to accept whatever lower ratio we choose. It has all the feel of judicial alchemy.8  See Campbell, 538 U.S. at 429 (Scalia, J., dissenting); Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 361, 127 S. Ct. 1057, 166 L. Ed. 2d 940 (2007) (Thomas, J., dissenting).
Nevertheless, I join the court's opinion today because it is consistent with—perhaps even dictated by—precedent. In Grabinski, we held that a 27:1 ratio was just fine in a case involving the fraudulent sale of a used car, so I would conclude that the district-court-imposed 24.75:1 does the job here too. 203 F.3d at 1026. But the irony is not lost on me: we are deciding, in the name of due process, that the district court had to step in and override the outcome of a jury trial—the gold standard for due process in our judicial system.
