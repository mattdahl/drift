, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I agree that we should vacate Barthman's sentence, and more specifically, that he has established that it is "reasonably likely" that a calculation error in his federal sentence will lead to a longer overall stay in prison. Rosales-Mireles v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1897, 1910, 201 L. Ed. 2d 376 (2018) (discussing and applying the fourth requirement of plain-error review in the context of an error in calculating a defendant's advisory Sentencing Guidelines range). But not for the reason the court suggests.
What is significant here is that the Minnesota Supreme Court has granted discretionary review in Barthman's direct appeal, which occurs in only a small percentage of cases.2  See State v. Barthman, No. A17-1191, 2018 Minn. LEXIS 691 (Minn. Nov. 27, 2018) (order granting review). If Barthman's case presents a close call, as many cases granted discretionary review before a court of last resort do, then it is reasonably likely that Barthman's concurrent state sentence may well be vacated or shortened, meaning that his federal sentence could end up determining how long he spends in prison.
 Rather than focus on the specific facts of this case, however, the court broadly pronounces that the litmus test is "finality" under a theory that no one has briefed or argued. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 142, 129 S. Ct. 1423, 173 L. Ed. 2d 266 (2009) (explaining that the "fourth prong [of plain-error review] is meant to be applied on a case-specific and fact-intensive basis" (emphasis added)). It is a strange place to draw the line. Under Minnesota law, a "court may at any time correct a sentence not authorized by law," Minn. R. Crim. P. 27.03, subdiv. 9 (emphasis added), if it was "unauthorized . . . at the time it was imposed," State v. Schnagl, 859 N.W.2d 297, 301 (Minn. 2015). The Minnesota Supreme Court has allowed district courts to use this rule to correct a broad range of errors, even after direct appeal, so finality in this context means little under Minnesota law. See, e.g., Reynolds v. State, 888 N.W.2d 125, 129-30 (Minn. 2016) (permitting a court to correct a sentence imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment); State v. Humes, 581 N.W.2d 317, 321 (Minn. 1998) (upholding the correction of a sentence to add a term of conditional release).
In short, the simple fact that Barthman's state sentence is not yet final tells us little about whether his shorter, concurrent federal sentence could play a role at some point. Far more revealing is that the Minnesota Supreme Court has determined that Barthman's case, in particular, merits a closer look.
