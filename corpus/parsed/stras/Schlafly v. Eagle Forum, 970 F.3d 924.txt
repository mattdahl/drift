, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
Reliance on "inherent authority" to sanction parties for litigation misconduct should always be a last resort. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 42, 111 S. Ct. 2123, 115 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1991); see id. at 50 ("[W]hen there is bad-faith conduct in the course of litigation that could be adequately sanctioned under the Rules, the court ordinarily should rely on the Rules rather than the inherent power."). It is, after all, just another name for an "undelegated power[]"—one that should be exercised with "especial 'restraint and discretion.'" Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger, 137 S. Ct. 1178, 1186-87 n.5, 197 L. Ed. 2d 585 (2017) (quoting Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764, 100 S. Ct. 2455, 65 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1980)). The district court failed to show restraint here, much less "especial" restraint, by jumping straight to inherent authority without first considering whether it could sanction Schlafly under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1), (c) (authorizing sanctions for "needlessly increas[ing] the cost of litigation"). Because Rule 11 may well have been "up to the task," Chambers, 501 U.S. at 50, and the district court said nothing to suggest otherwise, I would vacate the award of attorney fees and remand for further consideration. For this reason, I respectfully dissent from Part II.B. of the court's opinion.5
