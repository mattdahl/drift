, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
Shooting someone multiple times in the course of a kidnapping sure sounds like a "crime of violence." 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(c)(1)(A); accord Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 2581, 192 L. Ed. 2d 569 (2015) (Alito, J., dissenting) (discussing "violent felon[ies]"). And were our task to examine the actual facts of this crime, no other conclusion would be possible. But our task is different: we must determine whether a kidnapping resulting in death necessarily requires the "use . . . of physical force." 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(c)(3)(A); Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 186 L. Ed. 2d 438 (2013); see Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2248, 195 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2016) ("Facts" have "no legal effect or consequence" and "ACCA, as we have always understood it, cares not a whit about them." (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).
Under what has come to be known as the "categorical approach," I would conclude that it does not. Consider a different set of facts. Suppose that an individual gets in a car with a person impersonating an Uber driver and dies, either in a tragic car accident caused by the driver's recklessness or by jumping out after discovering the driver's true identity. See United States v. Melton, 883 F.2d 336, 337 (5th Cir. 1989) (claiming to be an "off-duty cab driver" and kidnapping a passenger who allegedly "panicked[,] jumped out of [the] car," and died); see also United States v. Schneider, 905 F.3d 1088, 1092 (8th Cir. 2018) (concluding that a statute criminalizing reckless driving that "causes serious bodily injury" is not a crime of violence). Both scenarios qualify as kidnapping by "inveigle[ment]" or "decoy[]," and each "results" in death. 18 U.S.C. ยง 1201(a). And critically, neither involves the use of force.3 See Voisine v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2272, 2278-79, 195 L. Ed. 2d 736 (2016) (stating that "use" of force requires that force "be volitional"); Schneider, 905 F.3d at 1092. For that reason, and notwithstanding the court's abstract reasoning to the contrary, I respectfully dissent.4
