, concurring in the judgment.
This case is factually indistinguishable from United States v. Jones, 471 F.3d 868 (8th Cir. 2006). Compare id. at 870-71, 875, with ante at 2-3. See United States v. Martinez-Cortes, 566 F.3d 767, 770-71 (8th Cir. 2009). Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, I would simply rely on Jones and say nothing more.6  See Mader v. United States, 654 F.3d 794, 800 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc).
