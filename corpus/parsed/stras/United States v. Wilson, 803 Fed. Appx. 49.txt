, dissenting.
It is time to pause for a moment. I suspect that this case has already become moot, and in my view, we have an obligation to find out. Thomas v. Basham, 931 F.2d 521, 522-23 (8th Cir. 1991) (stating that we have a "special obligation" to consider our "own jurisdiction"). The Bureau of Prisons lists Montarrance Wilson's current location as a residential re-entry center, precisely where he asked to be placed in lieu of serving a sentence in federal prison. Ante at 2; Revocation Hr'g Tr. 11, ECF No. 74; Appellant Br. 9-11; Find an Inmate, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, http://bop.gov/inmateloc (last visited April 22, 2020); see Revocation J. 5, ECF No. 69 (prescribing a period of residence in a residential re-entry center following release from custody). If so, we are unable to give him anything he does not already have. I would ask the parties to clarify whether the case has become moot, and if not, why not. See Miller v. Whitehead, 527 F.3d 752, 756, 758 (8th Cir. 2008) (dismissing requests for a transfer to a residential re-entry center because the petitioners had already received a transfer while the case was pending on appeal). What I would not do is duck a possible jurisdictional problem by rushing to decide the merits. I respectfully dissent.
