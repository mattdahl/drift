, dissenting.
We should hold counsel to the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967). We have been clear that "Anders briefing must be done as an advocate," Evans v. Clarke, 868 F.2d 267, 268 (8th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), not as a way of highlighting the arguments that the government would make, Smith v. United States, 384 F.2d 649, 650 (8th Cir. 1967). Yet throughout the abbreviated five-page "argument" section in the brief, counsel devotes more space to arguing against his client's interests than in favor of them. See Robinson v. Black, 812 F.2d 1084, 1086 (8th Cir. 1987) (explaining that counsel may not "brief[] all issues in favor of the government"). This, as we have said before, is not the way to write an Anders brief. See id. (stating that an Anders brief must "show[] the most favorable side of the defendant's arguments"); see also Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 82, 109 S. Ct. 346, 102 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1988) (explaining why a deficient Anders brief is problematic). Accordingly, before I would even consider this case, I would first have counsel comply with Anders.
