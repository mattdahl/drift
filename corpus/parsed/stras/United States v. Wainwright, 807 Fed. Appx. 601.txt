, concurring in the judgment.
Circuit precedent requires me to concur in the court's judgment. United States v. Evans, 738 F.3d 935, 936-37 (8th Cir. 2014) (per curiam); see Mader v. United States, 654 F.3d 794, 800 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (explaining that we are bound by a prior panel decision). But I cannot join the court's opinion, which suggests that our precedent is correct. As I have explained before, allowing judges, rather than juries, to find these facts runs afoul of fundamental Sixth Amendment principles and what the Supreme Court has said about them. See United States v. Perry, 908 F.3d 1126, 1134 (8th Cir. 2018) (Stras, J., concurring). No matter how many other courts have misstepped along the way, my view remains unchanged.
