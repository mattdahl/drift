).
Relator Ronald L. Schober's late filing with this court does not satisfy the requisite strict adherence to the statutory filing requirements for tax court appeals. See Beuning Family LP v. Cnty. of Stearns, 817 N.W.2d 122, 129 (Minn. 2012). Accordingly, for many of the same reasons stated in my dissent in Harbaugh v. Commissioner of Revenue, 830 N.W.2d881, 2013 Minn. LEXIS 273, No. A12-1342 (Minn. May 22, 2013), I would dismiss Schober's petition for a writ of certiorari in this case.
DIETZEN, Justice (dissenting).
I join in the dissent of Justice Stras.
