I have doubts whether, under basic sovereign-immunity principles, a state may be haled into federal court solely for the purpose of answering a third-party subpoena. See Alltel Commc'ns, LLC v. DeJordy, 675 F.3d 1100, 1105-06 (8th Cir. 2012) (prohibiting this practice under the common-law doctrine of tribal immunity); see also Crowe & Dunlevy, P.C. v. Stidham, 640 F.3d 1140, 1154 (10th Cir. 2011) ("The scope of tribal immunity, however, is more limited [than state sovereign immunity]."). But because we approved of this practice in a nearly identical case, In re Mo. Dep't of Nat. Res., 105 F.3d 434, 436 (8th Cir. 1997), I reluctantly join the court's opinion.
