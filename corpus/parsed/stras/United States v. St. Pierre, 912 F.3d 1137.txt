, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the court's explanation of why St. Pierre's appeal waiver requires us to dismiss his appeal, but I would end the opinion there. Once we dismiss St. Pierre's appeal, there is nothing left to do. To proceed further and address the underlying merits, as the court does, both defeats the appeal waiver and is at odds with the judgment, which is to dismiss rather than affirm. Accordingly, I join the court's opinion except its unnecessary discussion of the merits of St. Pierre's appeal.
