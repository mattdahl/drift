The court says more than it needs to about an issue that it never decides: whether a warrant is "executed" when it is delivered to someone in possession of digital data or, instead, when the data is finally turned over to the authorities. Although the court claims not to "definitively" resolve this difficult question, it devotes over two pages to it and all but supplies us with the answer.4  Because I agree that the officers were not reckless and that Nyah suffered no prejudice, see United States v. Spencer, 439 F.3d 905, 913 (8th Cir. 2006), my analysis would end there and it would leave a future panel with a chance to decide the question on a clean slate.
