, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
The officers who searched the house relied in good faith on a validly issued and facially reasonable anticipatory search warrant, so even if the triggering condition was overly broad and failed to establish probable cause under the unusual facts of this case, Brown is not entitled to suppression. See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984); United States v. Livesay, 983 F.2d 135, 137-38 (8th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, I concur and join all but Part II.A of the court's opinion.
