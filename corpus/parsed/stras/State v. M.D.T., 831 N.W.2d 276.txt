 GILDEA, Chief Justice.
This case arises from respondent M.D.T.'s petition to expunge records relating to her aggravated forgery conviction. The district court granted M.D.T.'s request and ordered "[a]ll official records" to "be sealed and their existence . . . be disclosed only by court order." The court of appeals affirmed the district court. State v. M.D.T., 815 N.W.2d 628 (Minn. App. 2012). Because we conclude that the district court did not have inherent authority to expunge M.D.T.'s records held in the executive branch, we reverse that part of the court of appeals' decision.
On February 7, 2006, police arrested M.D.T. for presenting an altered prescription to a Shopko pharmacy. M.D.T. presented a prescription for Robitussin with codeine—a controlled substance—that was altered to increase the prescribed amount from 200 to 400 milliliters. In her statement to police, M.D.T. admitted that she had altered the prescription and said that she did so because she "did not have enough money to go back to the doctor if the medicine did not work."
The State subsequently charged M.D.T. with two counts of aggravated forgery in violation of Minn. Stat. § 609.625, subd. 1(1) (2012) ("making or altering"), and Minn. Stat. § 609.625, subds. 1(1), 3 (2012) ("uttering or possessing"), and one count of controlled substance crime in the fifth degree in violation of Minn. Stat. § 152.025, subds. 2(2)(i), 3(a) (2008) ("procurement by fraud"). M.D.T. entered an Alford plea 1  to the aggravated forgery by "uttering or possessing" count. In January 2007, the district court convicted M.D.T. of aggravated forgery pursuant to her plea, and stayed the imposition of M.D.T.'s sentence subject to several conditions. The conditions included that M.D.T. complete three years of supervised probation and pay an $879 fine. In February 2008, M.D.T. was discharged early from probation and $600 of her fine was forgiven.
Approximately seven months after she was discharged from probation, M.D.T. filed a petition for expungement of her criminal record. M.D.T. sought expungement because she wanted to "move on with [her] life," "go to college," and "start [a] career." M.D.T. claimed her record precluded her from following "through with [her] career in business management in accounting." The district court denied M.D.T.'s petition.
 On January 31, 2011, M.D.T. filed a second petition for expungement. M.D.T. sought expungement because her conviction was impeding her "lifelong dream of becoming an accountant." M.D.T. argued she was qualified for expungement because she had been rehabilitated and the benefit of expunging her record outweighed any disadvantage to the public and the court. The petition detailed M.D.T.'s employment history, career plans, personal history, and education. The petition also noted that M.D.T. had no convictions other than the aggravated forgery conviction.
In addition to M.D.T.'s petition and the materials she submitted, the district court received a letter from the Director of Rock Nobles Community Corrections, indicating that the agency was not "opposed to the expungement of this case." The Nobles County Attorney, however, opposed the petition.
The district court granted M.D.T.'s motion to expunge her criminal records. The court found "clear and convincing evidence that sealing [M.D.T.'s] record would yield a benefit . . . commensurate with the disadvantages to the public." The court noted that precedent regarding expungement of executive branch records is "unclear," and, relying on three unpublished cases from the court of appeals, utilized a "more expansive view of the Court's inherent judicial authority." Citing State v. S.L.H., 755 N.W.2d 271 (Minn. 2008), and State v. C.A., 304 N.W.2d 353 (Minn. 1981), the district court reasoned that M.D.T.'s "one-time mistake of altering a minor cold medicine prescription," in light of her rehabilitative efforts, did not justify hindering M.D.T.'s employment options for 15 years. As such, the court sealed "[a]ll official records held by" the Nobles County District Court, Sheriff, and County Attorney; Worthington City Police Department and City Attorney; Minnesota Attorney General's Office; Minnesota Department of Corrections; Probation/Court Services Department; and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension ("BCA").
The State appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed. M.D.T., 815 N.W.2d 628. The court of appeals held that the district court had the inherent authority to expunge M.D.T.'s records. Id. at 639. The court also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering the expungement of M.D.T.'s criminal records "generated and held by the judicial branch and the sealing of [the] records maintained by the executive branch." Id. The court concluded that expungement of M.D.T.'s records implicated the judiciary's fundamental function of maintaining and disseminating criminal records that were sealed by the judicial branch. Id. We granted the State's petition for review.
We review the lower court's decision on whether to expunge criminal records "under an abuse of discretion standard." State v. Ambaye, 616 N.W.2d 256, 261 (Minn. 2000). But the question presented in this case—whether the district court exceeded the scope of its inherent authority to expunge criminal records—is a question of law. State v. Chauvin, 723 N.W.2d 20, 23 (Minn. 2006). We review questions of law de novo. Modrow v. JP Foodservice, Inc., 656 N.W.2d 389, 393 (Minn. 2003).
I.
There are two bases for expungement of criminal records in Minnesota: Minn. Stat. ch. 609A (2012) and the judiciary's inherent authority. S.L.H., 755 N.W.2d at 274. M.D.T. does not claim she is entitled to statutory expungement; she argues instead that the district court possessed inherent authority to expunge her criminal records. Accordingly, the only question in this case involves inherent authority.
 The parties dispute whether the district court exceeded the scope of its inherent authority when it expunged "all official records" of M.D.T.'s conviction. 2  The State argues that the district court exceeded its inherent authority when it expunged M.D.T.'s criminal records held in the executive branch. M.D.T. contends that, because the district court expunged her records held by the judicial branch, the district court properly exercised its inherent authority by expunging executive branch records to "effectuate a meaningful remedy." The amici argue that public policy weighs in favor of allowing courts to provide a "complete expungement remedy in appropriate circumstances."
The judiciary's inherent power "governs that which is essential to the existence, dignity, and function of a court because it is a court." In re Clerk of Lyon Cnty. Courts' Comp., 308 Minn. 172, 176, 241 N.W.2d 781, 784 (1976). The origin of judicial power in Minnesota is our state constitution. Minn. Const. art. VI, § 1 (vesting "[t]he judicial power of the state" in the "supreme court, a court of appeals, if established by the legislature, a district court and such other courts . . . as the legislature may establish"). But " 'when the court came into existence it came with inherent powers.' " State by Archabal v. Cnty. of Hennepin, 505 N.W.2d 294, 298 n.6 (Minn. 1993) (quoting In re Greathouse, 189 Minn. 51, 55, 248 N.W. 735, 737 (1933)). The inherent power derives from the judiciary's "right to protect itself, to enable it to administer justice whether any previous form of remedy has been granted or not." In re Greathouse, 189 Minn. at 55, 248 N.W. at 737.
In order to determine whether inherent authority exists, we ask "whether the relief requested by the court or aggrieved party is necessary to the performance of the judicial function as contemplated in our state constitution." Clerk of Lyon Cnty. Courts' Comp., 308 Minn. at 181, 241 N.W.2d at 786. We apply that test "with due consideration" for the other branches of government and do not rely on inherent authority to serve the "relative needs or . . . wants" of the judicial branch. Id. at 181-82, 241 N.W.2d at 786. We have also recognized that courts must be mindful not to "use judicial authority to enforce or restrain acts which lie within the executive and legislative jurisdictions." Granada Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 455 v. Mattheis, 284 Minn. 174, 180, 170 N.W.2d 88, 91 (1969). And when a question arises regarding the scope of the judiciary's inherent authority, courts must "resolve all reasonable doubts in favor of a co-ordinate branch." Gollnik v. Mengel, 112 Minn. 349, 350-51, 128 N.W. 292, 292 (1910).
In the area of expungement, we have held that the judiciary may use its inherent authority to expunge criminal records where "the petitioner's constitutional rights may be seriously infringed by retention of his records." In re R.L.F., 256 N.W.2d 803, 808 (Minn. 1977). M.D.T.  does not argue that expungement is needed to protect her constitutional rights.
We have also recognized that inherent authority may extend to expungement of criminal records when expungement is necessary to " 'the performance of judicial functions.' " Barlow v. Comm'r of Pub. Safety, 365 N.W.2d 232, 234 (Minn. 1985) (quoting C.A., 304 N.W.2d at 358). We first recognized this potential in C.A., 304 N.W.2d at 358-59.
M.D.T. argues that the district court had inherent authority to expunge her criminal records based on our dicta in C.A. The district court likewise cited C.A. to support its conclusion that its inherent authority reached into the executive branch. In C.A., we recognized in dicta that the judiciary has the inherent authority to expunge criminal records when doing so serves a "unique judicial function[]." Id. at 358. The unique judicial function at issue in our discussion in C.A. was the judiciary's ability to remedy the unfairness to C.A. from the accessibility of his criminal records even after his conviction had been set aside. See S.L.H., 755 N.W.2d at 277 (discussing C.A., 304 N.W.2d at 358-59). In the context of a conviction having been set aside, expungement of the petitioner's records held outside the judiciary could be viewed as "closely tied to the core judicial function of granting full relief . . . to the petitioner." 3  Id.
M.D.T.'s reliance on C.A. to support expungment of her records is misplaced. The unfairness issue we discussed in C.A. is simply not present in this case because M.D.T.'s conviction has not been set aside. To the extent the district court relied on the unfairness analysis in C.A. to support its use of inherent authority to expunge M.D.T.'s records held in the executive branch, the court exceeded its authority. Unlike C.A., M.D.T. stands convicted of the offense that is reflected in the records she seeks to expunge. See S.L.H., 755 N.W.2d at 277 ("The unfairness concern at issue in C.A. . . . is not implicated in the same way in this case because S.L.H. continues to stand convicted of the . . . crime. Because S.L.H.'s conviction has not been set aside, the expungement of her criminal records held outside the judicial branch is not necessary to grant her full relief.").
Moreover, even in the context of C.A., where the conviction had been set aside, we still did not order expungement of records held in the executive branch. 304 N.W.2d at 355. Indeed, we have never held that the judiciary's inherent authority to order expungement extends to records held in the executive branch. See S.L.H., 755 N.W.2d at 280; Ambaye, 616 N.W.2d at 261; In re Quinn, 517 N.W.2d 895, 900 (1994); Barlow, 365 N.W.2d at 234-35.
M.D.T. nevertheless argues that expungement of her criminal records held in the executive branch is necessary to the performance of a unique judicial function because the judiciary expunged its own records and so the records held in the  executive branch must be expunged as well. Specifically, M.D.T. argues that expungement of executive branch records is part of the judicial function to control court records and agents of the court in possession of court records. We said in C.A. that the judiciary has inherent authority to control court records. 304 N.W.2d at 361 ("The clerk is subject to the inherent power of the court to control its internal records."). But the authority the judiciary has to control its own records does not give the judiciary inherent authority to reach into the executive branch to control what the executive branch does with records held in that branch, even when those records were created in the judiciary.
This is so because of our "mandate" that the judiciary " 'proceed cautiously' " in relying on "inherent authority." S.L.H., 755 N.W.2d at 278 (quoting C.A., 304 N.W.2d at 359). This caution is rooted in separation of powers concerns. Id. And specifically with regard to expungement, we have recognized that the judiciary is not to resort to inherent authority when doing so would not "respect the equally unique authority of" another branch of government. C.A., 304 N.W.2d at 359; cf. Clerk of Lyon Cnty. Courts' Comp., 308 Minn. at 181-82, 241 N.W.2d at 786 ("The test [for determining whether inherent authority exists] must be applied with due consideration for equally important executive and legislative functions."). It is particularly apt in this case for us to adhere to that cautionary approach because of the clear legislative expressions of policy that confirm that M.D.T.'s criminal records held in the executive branch are public information.
The first such legislative expression is contained in Minn. Stat. ch. 609A. In this chapter, the Legislature identified the specific circumstances where a court may expunge criminal records held in the executive branch. In chapter 609A, the Legislature provided for the expungement of criminal records for certain controlled substance crimes, Minn. Stat. § 609A.02, subd. 1, certain juvenile offenders prosecuted as adults, Minn. Stat. § 609A.02, subd. 2, and certain criminal cases that do not result in convictions, Minn. Stat. § 609A.02, subd. 3. But the Legislature did not provide for expungement of the criminal records of someone like M.D.T., who stands convicted of aggravated forgery.
The second relevant legislative policy is contained in the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act ("MDPA"), which "establishes a presumption that government data are public." Minn. Stat. § 13.01, subd. 3 (2012). More specifically, "data created or collected by law enforcement agencies which documents any actions taken by them to cite, arrest, incarcerate or otherwise substantially deprive an adult individual of liberty" is to "be public at all times in the originating agency." Minn. Stat. § 13.82, subd. 2 (2012). The MDPA also states that:
[D]ata created, collected, or maintained by the [BCA] that identify an individual who was convicted of a crime, the offense of which the individual was convicted, associated court disposition and sentence information, controlling agency, and confinement information are public data for 15 years following the discharge of the sentence imposed for the offense.
Minn. Stat. § 13.87, subd. 1(b) (2012). Under section 13.87, subdivision 1(b), records that relate to a defendant's conviction, sentence, and confinement are public for 15 years following the discharge of a defendant's sentence, whether those records are created by the executive branch or the judicial branch. Because 15 years have  not elapsed since the discharge of M.D.T.'s sentence, the Legislature has determined in the MDPA that M.D.T.'s criminal records are public data. 4 
Recognition of inherent judicial authority to expunge M.D.T.'s criminal records held in the executive branch would effectively override the legislative policy judgments expressed in both of these statutes. We have said, however, that "the exercise of inherent authority must be delineated in such a way as to accommodate those policies where appropriate." C.A., 304 N.W.2d at 359. It is plainly appropriate to recognize and accommodate legislative policy judgments in the context of expungement of criminal records held outside the judiciary. As the California Supreme Court noted, "the difficult task of striking the proper balance between [the] competing concerns" of public access and privacy rights is uniquely suited to the legislative branch. Loder v. Mun. Court for San Diego Judicial Dist., 17 Cal. 3d 859, 132 Cal. Rptr. 464, 553 P.2d 624, 636 (Cal. 1976) (declining to use inherent judicial authority to expunge arrest records). We agree, and our Legislature has struck that balance with respect to M.D.T.'s criminal records held in the executive branch. It is not necessary to the performance of a judicial function to strike the balance differently. 5 
Finally, M.D.T. relies on the district court's conclusion that the benefit to M.D.T. of expungement of her criminal records outweighs the disadvantages to the public of expungement. Based on this balancing, M.D.T. urges us to uphold the expungement of her records held in the executive branch. In C.A., we articulated the balancing test the district court used. 304 N.W.2d at 358 (noting that "the court must decide whether expungement will  yield a benefit to the petitioner commensurate with the disadvantages to the public from the elimination of the record and the burden on the court in issuing, enforcing and monitoring an expungement order"). This balancing test, however, is relevant only after the court concludes, as a threshold matter, that expungement is necessary to the performance of a unique judicial function. 6  Id. As we have concluded above, expungement of M.D.T.'s records held in the executive branch is not necessary to the performance of a unique judicial function. That conclusion is dispositive, and makes it unnecessary to engage in the balancing test we discussed in C.A.
Because expungement of M.D.T's criminal records held in the executive branch is not necessary to the performance of a unique judicial function, we hold that the district court did not have the authority to expunge M.D.T.'s criminal records held in the executive branch.

STRAS, Justice (concurring).
This case raises fundamental questions about the judiciary's authority under the Minnesota Constitution. The narrow question raised by this case is whether district courts may, consistent with the Minnesota Constitution, expunge executive-branch records. The court answers that question with reference to the judiciary's "inherent authority." However, like many of our prior decisions, the court fails to explore the source, if any, of the judiciary's "inherent authority." To put it bluntly: inherent in what?
Even a cursory review of our cases reveals that the phrase "inherent authority" is a misnomer—one devoid of any real meaning. Rather, when discussing "inherent authority," we are really referring to the "judicial power"—the grant of authority to the judicial branch in article VI, section 1 of the Minnesota Constitution. The judicial power clause vests the "judicial power" in "a supreme court, a court of appeals, if established by the legislature, a district court, and such other courts . . . as the legislature may establish." Minn. Const. art. VI, § 1. Unlike the United States Constitution, the Minnesota Constitution also contains a freestanding separation of powers clause, which divides the powers of government into "three distinct departments: legislative, executive and judicial." Minn. Const. art. III, § 1. That clause prohibits the "distinct departments" of government from exercising any of the powers "belonging to either of the others except in the instances expressly provided in this [C]onstitution." Id.; see also In re Application of Senate, 10 Minn. 78, 81, 10 Gilf. 56 (Gil. 56) (1865) (explaining that the Minnesota Constitution "prevents an assumption by either department of power not properly belonging to it"). While the separation of powers does "not mean absolute division of our government's function," Holmberg v. Holmberg, 588 N.W.2d 720, 723 (Minn. 1999), we have never permitted one branch to exercise the power exclusively assigned to another, see Quam v. State, 391 N.W.2d 803, 809 (Minn. 1986).
While providing some guidance, the Minnesota Constitution does not describe  the "judicial power," other than to tell us where it is vested—the courts—and what it is not—the powers exercised by the legislative and executive branches. However, the phrase "judicial power," unlike "inherent authority," had a widely understood meaning when the residents of the territory of Minnesota ratified the Minnesota Constitution in 1857. The essence of the "[j]udicial power is the power that adjudicates upon the rights of persons or property, and to that end declares, construes and applies the law." Hunstiger v. Kilian, 130 Minn. 474, 477, 153 N.W. 869, 870 (1915); cf. Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 59 U.S. 272, 284, 15 L. Ed. 372 (1856) (noting in 1856, just 1 year prior to the ratification of the Minnesota Constitution, that the "judicial power" extends to "any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity"). The core of the "judicial power," therefore, is to decide cases. See Stern v. Marshall, 131 S. Ct. 2594, 2609, 180 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2011) (stating that the United States Constitution assigns to the judiciary the job of resolving " 'the mundane as well as the glamorous, matters of common law and statute as well as constitutional law, issues of fact as well as issues of law' " (quoting N. Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 86-87 n.39, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1982)).
Even within that core, however, the judiciary's power has limits. For example, the "judicial power" extends only to the resolution of actual controversies and does not permit us to render advisory opinions, no matter how important the legal question. See Seiz v. Citizens Pure Ice Co., 207 Minn. 277, 281, 290 N.W. 802, 804 (1940). In fact, the lack of a justiciable controversy deprives courts of subject matter jurisdiction—a prerequisite for the exercise of "judicial power." Id.; see also Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. Litchfield Precision Components, Inc., 456 N.W.2d 434, 439 (Minn. 1990) (" 'Issues which have no existence other than in the realm of future possibility are purely hypothetical and are not justiciable.' " (quoting Lee v. Delmont, 228 Minn. 101, 110, 36 N.W.2d 530, 537 (1949)). The Minnesota Constitution also imposes certain procedural limitations on the exercise of the "judicial power." For example, the Minnesota Constitution explicitly forbids this court from presiding over jury trials. Minn. Const. art. VI, § 2 (granting this court "appellate jurisdiction," but mandating that "there shall be no trial by jury in the supreme court"); Prignitz v. Fischer, 4 Minn. 366, 367, 4 Gilf. 275 (Gil. 275) (1860) ("Since the adoption of the [Minnesota] [C]onstitution there can be no trial by jury in [the supreme] court."). It is clear, therefore, that the "judicial power" is limited by the traditional understanding of that phrase, as articulated in our justiciability cases, and by the Minnesota Constitution, which prohibits courts from exercising the power belonging to any other department of government and constrains the exercise of "judicial power."
Our cases exercising "inherent authority" are not so circumscribed. We have variously invoked our "inherent authority" to promulgate rules of evidence and procedure, e.g., State v. McCoy, 682 N.W.2d 153, 160 (Minn. 2004), to strike down statutorily imposed limitations on attorney fees, Irwin v. Surdyks Liquor, 599 N.W.2d 132, 141-42 (Minn. 1999), to order public entities in litigation to hold settlement conferences, State by Archabal v. Cnty. of Hennepin, 505 N.W.2d 294, 298 (Minn. 1993), and to regulate admission to the bar and supervise the conduct of lawyers, In re Petition for Integration of the Bar of Minn., 216 Minn. 195, 198-99, 12 N.W.2d 515, 517-18 (1943). We have even invoked our "inherent authority" to place a fee on all Minnesota  lawyers to fund the State Public Defender's Office, notwithstanding the fact that the power to tax is vested in the legislative branch by article IV, section 18 of the Minnesota Constitution. 7  See Order Temporarily Increasing Lawyer Registration Fees, No. C1-81-1206, 2009 Minn. LEXIS 975, *4 (Minn. filed Nov. 4, 2009). Finally, we have relied on "our inherent authority to hear an appeal in the interests of justice" over which we would otherwise lack jurisdiction. See State v. Obeta, 796 N.W.2d 282, 286-87 (Minn. 2011).
We have therefore invoked our "inherent authority" in a "kaleidoscope of circumstances" that defies categorization. State v. Beecroft, 813 N.W.2d 814, 867-68 (Minn. 2012) (Stras, J., dissenting). And similar to our jurisprudence on the "interests of justice," "the standard for invoking the power cannot be precisely described or defined." Id. at 868 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Perhaps the most apt description of "inherent authority," like the "interests of justice," is that it resembles some sort of trump card that courts play when direct constitutional authority is absent. 8  The flaw in such an approach, however, is that it turns the relevant constitutional analysis on its head: rather than determining whether particular actions are included within the "judicial power," we ask the converse question of whether any provision of the Minnesota Constitution explicitly prohibits those actions. Inverting the constitutional analysis has led to the untethered, freewheeling approach to "inherent authority" that saturates our case law. See, e.g., Adrian Vermeule, The Judicial Power in the State (and Federal) Courts, 2000 Sup. Ct. Rev. 357, 360 (2000) (arguing that "state [court] decisions articulate conceptions of judicial authority that sweep beyond any defensible conception of judicial power").
 I do not mean to suggest, however, that all invocations of our "inherent authority" have been inconsistent with the "judicial power." To the contrary, I have little doubt that the "judicial power" includes the authority to "punish direct contempt whether or not statutory authorization exists." State v. Tatum, 556 N.W.2d 541, 547 (Minn. 1996). As we have stated, " '[t]he [contempt] power is essential to the effectiveness of all other court powers.' " Id. (quoting In re Welfare of R.L.W., 309 Minn. 489, 491-93, 245 N.W.2d 204, 205-06 (1976)). Nor do I question a court's power to "issue orders to protect the confidentiality of documents and other records" presented to the court. In re GlaxoSmithKline PLC, 732 N.W.2d 257, 269 (Minn. 2007). Rather, my view is that these powers are reserved to the courts because they fall within the traditional understanding of the "judicial power," not because they satisfy some ethereal notion of "inherent authority." See Eash v. Riggins Trucking, Inc., 757 F.2d 557, 561 (3d Cir. 1985) (en banc) (describing inherent authority "as nebulous[] and its bounds as shadowy" (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).
With that framework in mind, I now turn to the narrow legal question presented in this case: whether we have the authority to expunge criminal records held by the executive branch. Although it is not clear to me that district courts have the authority to expunge criminal records held in the judicial branch in the absence of statutory authority to do so, 9  the question presented in this case is straightforward. M.D.T. seeks a remedy—the expungement of criminal records held in executive agencies such as the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Department of Human Services—that is beyond the traditional understanding of the "judicial power." The core of the "judicial power" is to decide cases and controversies, not to reach over to the other departments of government and order them to expunge their records. See, e.g., Loder v. Mun. Court for San Diego Judicial Dist., 17 Cal. 3d 859, 132 Cal. Rptr. 464, 553 P.2d 624, 636 (Cal. 1976) (holding that expungement is permissible only when the legislative branch has provided a remedy); Mulkey v. Purdy, 234 So.2d 108, 110-11 (Fla. 1970) (same); see also United States v. Meyer, 439 F.3d 855, 862 (8th Cir. 2006) ("Permitting the expungement of a record solely on equitable grounds would interfere with state and  federal laws that rely on the existence of accurate and complete criminal records."). To hold otherwise would require us not only to ignore the limited scope of the "judicial power," but also to disregard the separation of powers clause in the Minnesota Constitution. The Legislature, within its grant of "legislative power," has already established a comprehensive scheme that delineates the circumstances in which the judiciary has the authority to order the expungement of executive branch records—a remedy to which M.D.T. is not entitled. See Minn. Stat. § 609A.01 (2012) ("This chapter provides the grounds and procedures for expungement of criminal records . . . ."). M.D.T.'s request, "if granted, would amount to an extraordinary inter-branch incursion," United States v. Lucido, 612 F.3d 871, 875 (6th Cir. 2010), because the other departments of government have already spoken in an area that falls within their constitutional grant of authority.
In light of the limited scope of the "judicial power" and the constitutional mandate for separation of powers, I agree with the court that the district court abused its discretion in relying on "inherent authority" to expunge executive-branch records. However, because I depart from the court's reasoning, I concur only in the result.
