, concurring in the judgment.
The court and I arrive at the same destination, but I would take a more direct route. Unwieldy as the statute may at first appear,2  Congress unambiguously instructed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to "determine[]" the "costs incurred" from "furnishing hospital services" to Medicaid patients. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396r-4(g)(1)(A). Based on a disagreement with the Secretary's decision to deduct insurance and Medicare payments from the calculation, the Missouri Hospital Association challenges his decision-making authority. My analysis begins and ends with the plain language of the statute.
The parties' dispute is straightforward: may the Secretary exclude from "costs incurred" those expenses that have been reimbursed by insurance companies and other third-party payors? The only possible  answer under the statute is yes. Whatever ambiguity lies in the word "costs," ante at 4, is cleared up by the following word, "incurred." To incur a cost is to "sustain" it or be "liable or subject to" it. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 891 (5th ed. 2016); accord Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1146 (2002). Hospitals have not sustained, and are not liable for, any costs that have been reimbursed by third parties, including by Medicare and private insurance. So the Secretary has the authority to exclude them.
Indeed, the statute's grammatical structure leaves no possible alternative reading. After all, the phrase "costs incurred" is followed by a parenthetical that both clarifies its meaning ("net of payments") and contains an express grant of authority ("as determined by the Secretary"). Aside from the specific statutory directions about how to treat payments from Medicaid, uninsured patients, and state and local governments, the Secretary gets to make the call.
The Association nevertheless urges us to read the words, "as determined by the Secretary," as narrowly as possible. It says that the statute empowers the Secretary to take only two actions: calculate each hospital's total costs from treating Medicaid patients and then deduct reimbursements from Medicaid and payments by uninsured patients. According to the Association, the statute's express instruction to treat these two categories of payments as deductible means that all others are not, regardless of what the Secretary says.
There are at least two problems with this interpretation. The first is that, if the Association is right that the listing of two deductible categories means that everything else is excluded, the last sentence would be redundant because there would be no reason to specifically exclude payments by state and local governments. See Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351, 358, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d 411 (2014) (applying the "cardinal principle" that "courts must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The second is that, because states calculate "payment adjustment[s]" and "report" them to the Secretary, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396r-4(c), (j)(1), there would be nothing left for the Secretary to "determine[]." See Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1002, 1010, 197 L. Ed. 2d 354 (2017) ("Interpretation of a phrase of uncertain reach is not confined to a single sentence when the text of the whole statute gives instruction as to its meaning." (brackets and citation omitted)). But see Tenn. Hosp. Ass'n v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1049 (6th Cir. 2018) (Kethledge, J., concurring in judgment) (stating that there is still plenty left for the Secretary to "determine[]" even if excluding other third-party payments is beyond his power).
The bottom line is that the Secretary did exactly as instructed by "determin[ing]" which payments to deduct in calculating "costs incurred." Faced with a clear statute and no challenge to the scope of the delegation, I would end the analysis there. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 843 n.9, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). See generally Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 204 L. Ed. 2d 522 (2019).
