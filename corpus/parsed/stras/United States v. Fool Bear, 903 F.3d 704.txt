, dissenting in part.
I disagree with the court on only one issue. I would affirm Fool Bear's conviction of attempted aggravated sexual abuse of a child because I think he had the intent to complete the crime and did just enough to have taken a "substantial step" toward its completion. At the very least, the government presented sufficient evidence for the jury to have reasonably concluded that both of these elements were satisfied.
First, the government proved Fool Bear's intent to penetrate his niece. His niece, who was only ten years old at the time of the incident, testified that Fool Bear told her to "come l[ie] with [him]," placed her hand on his erect penis, and then rubbed her vagina underneath her clothes. Although these kinds of sexual acts alone are typically insufficient to establish "the actor's ultimate intent" to penetrate a victim, United States v. Plenty Arrows, 946 F.2d 62, 66 (8th Cir. 1991), the government offered more here, see United States v. Wright, 540 F.3d 833, 840-41 (8th Cir. 2008).
According to the niece, beginning just a few months after the first encounter, Fool Bear regularly penetrated her once or twice a month for the next four years. We have repeatedly held that the government may introduce other bad acts and crimes "to establish knowledge and intent." United States v. Geddes, 844 F.3d 983, 990 (8th Cir. 2017) (citation and brackets omitted); see also United States v. Brumfield, 686 F.3d 960, 962-63 (8th Cir. 2012) (explaining that evidence that the defendant had "propositioned [a minor] to have sex with him while he videotaped it" was admissible to show intent to possess child pornography). Indeed, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the jury was specifically permitted to "consider[]" evidence that Fool Bear "committed . . . other sexual assault[s]" because it was "relevant" to determining whether he had the intent to penetrate her. Fed. R. Evid. 413(a); accord Fed. R. Evid. 414(a); see also United States v. Oldrock, 867 F.3d 934, 939 (8th Cir. 2017) (explaining that evidence that the defendant had engaged in "similar[] . . . touching" with a "similar[ly] . . . age[d]" minor was admissible as propensity evidence under Rule 413(a)). And, contrary to the court's suggestion that Fool Bear's other bad acts are immaterial because they did not occur "prior to [the first encounter]," ante at 6, we have explained that "[t]he mere subsequency of an act to that charged in an indictment does not on that ground alone make it incompetent to establish intent or motive," United States v. Riley, 657 F.2d 1377, 1388 (8th Cir. 1981) (citation omitted); accord United States v. Brown, 923 F.2d 109, 111 (8th Cir. 1991).
Fool Bear's later acts of sexual abuse were sufficiently similar and close in time to the first encounter to allow the jury to infer his "ultimate intent." Plenty Arrows, 946 F.2d at 66; cf. United States v. Walker, 470 F.3d 1271, 1275 (8th Cir. 2006) (affirming the admission of an 18-year-old offense). For example, in discussing one of the completed penetrations that occurred  just "a few months" later, the niece testified that she stayed home from school, Fool Bear abused her in his bedroom, the encounter involved contact with her vagina, and it ended with a warning that she was not to "tell anyone or else [they would] both get in trouble." The first encounter shared these same characteristics. The jury could have reasonably inferred, based on a continuous course of sexual abuse that began shortly thereafter, lasted several years, and involved a recurring pattern of behavior, that Fool Bear intended to penetrate his niece the first time he touched her.
Second, Fool Bear's conduct, which included placing his niece's hand on his erect penis and touching her vagina under her clothes, was a "substantial step" toward completion of a crime requiring penetration. A substantial step is an act that is "more than mere preparation," but it "may be less than the last act necessary before the actual commission of the substantive crime." United States v. Mazzella, 768 F.2d 235, 240 (8th Cir. 1985) (quoting United States v. Manley, 632 F.2d 978, 987 (2d Cir. 1980)). The jury may consider "circumstantial evidence" in determining whether a particular act "constitute[s] a substantial step." See United States v. Burks, 135 F.3d 582, 584 (8th Cir. 1998).
Here, the jury knew that Fool Bear intended to, and actually did, penetrate his niece on a number of other occasions. And by the time the first encounter ended, Fool Bear was well on his way toward penetrating her. See, e.g., United States v. Villarreal, 707 F.3d 942, 961 (8th Cir. 2013) (concluding that touching the victim's vagina was a substantial step toward committing sexual abuse). Under Mazzella, he did enough, as it was not necessary for him to have actually penetrated her, or even been on the verge of penetrating her, for his conduct to have crossed the line into an attempt. Only a substantial step, not a completed or nearly completed offense, is required.
The court nevertheless concludes that "the touching and rubbing of genitalia" during the first encounter was not a substantial step toward penetration because it "constitute[d] a different sex act." Ante at 7. But just because an act completes one crime does not mean that it cannot also qualify as a substantial step toward the commission of another, different crime. A would-be killer who breaks into the intended victim's home has not only committed a burglary, he has also completed a substantial step toward committing a murder. See, e.g., Model Penal Code ยง 5.01(2)(d) (explaining that "unlawful entry of a structure . . . in which it is contemplated that the crime will be committed" is a substantial step). The same is true here.
* * *
The jury heard evidence that Fool Bear sexually abused his niece over the course of four years, beginning when she was just ten years old, and that the abuse followed a predictable pattern. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the jury to have found that Fool Bear intended to penetrate her from the very beginning and that his actions during their first encounter were a substantial step toward that end. Accordingly, I would conclude there is sufficient evidence to affirm Fool Bear's conviction of attempted aggravated sexual abuse of a child.
