, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
While explaining Smith's sentence and without any prompting from the parties, the district court discussed an unidentified study conducted by a court-retained criminologist. Even if this alone was not error, the court did not allow the parties to read the study, much less address its applicability to Smith or subject its methodology or conclusions to meaningful adversarial testing. By discussing the study without notifying the parties in advance or giving them a chance to respond, the court erred. See, e.g., United States v. Gant, 663 F.3d 1023, 1029-30 (8th Cir. 2011) (stating that, at sentencing, a court "may consider . . . uncorroborated hearsay, provided the defendant  is given a chance to rebut or explain it" (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted)); cf. U.S.S.G. ยง 6A1.3(a) ("When any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor.").
To be sure, the district court disclaimed any reliance on the study when it sentenced Smith, saying the study had no "impact" on its decision. But the court's statement did not cure its error. Rather, it reveals that the error did not affect Smith's substantial rights. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 142 n.4, 129 S. Ct. 1423, 173 L. Ed. 2d 266 (2009); United States v. Becker, 636 F.3d 402, 405-07 (8th Cir. 2011) (holding that the district court's "academic discussion" of undisclosed information, which "did not ultimately affect [the] sentencing decision," had no impact on the defendant's substantial rights). After all, saying that an error had no "impact" on a decision is the equivalent of saying that the error is harmless. E.g., United States v. Johnson, 848 F.3d 872, 880 (8th Cir. 2017). Accordingly, I too conclude that the district court's discussion of the study does not require us to reverse Smith's sentence, but for a different reason: the error did not affect his substantial rights.
