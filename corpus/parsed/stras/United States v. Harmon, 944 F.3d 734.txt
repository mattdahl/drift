This is how the law drifts. The court starts with the rule that a district court must make "specific factual findings" when an obstruction-of-justice enhancement rests on perjury, and apparently extends it to the alternative finding that Harmon interfered with a witness. Ante at 7; see United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 96-97, 113 S. Ct. 1111, 122 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1993) (explaining that this requirement ensures that district courts do not "enhance sentences as a matter of course whenever the accused takes the stand and is found guilty"). It relies exclusively on cases involving perjury, and none discusses any other possible ground for the enhancement.  See United States v. Tyndall, 521 F.3d 877, 882-83 (8th Cir. 2008); United States v. Abdul-Aziz, 486 F.3d 471, 478-79 (8th Cir. 2007); United States v. Flores, 362 F.3d 1030, 1037-39 (8th Cir. 2004). Yet the court does not acknowledge that it is applying a perjury-specific rule, nor tell us why this rule, which is motivated by concerns about protecting a defendant's right to testify, applies to a finding involving witness interference. See Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 96-97. With no answer, we can only guess.
My answer is different. I would rely on the general principle that district courts need not provide detailed findings as long as there is "sufficient evidence" in the record for "meaningful appellate review." United States v. Hairy Chin, 850 F.3d 398, 403 (8th Cir. 2017) (per curiam). There is more than enough here; no one was left guessing about what acts or evidence prompted the enhancement. The government presented evidence that Harmon asked one of its potential witnesses to write a letter about his character. Not only was this request improper, it violated an express condition of pretrial release. And when Harmon argued at sentencing that this act did not rise to the level of obstruction of justice, the court overruled his objections based on the "evidence presented." It is no mystery, then, how he ended up with the enhancement: he attempted, at least "indirectly," to "unlawfully influenc[e]" a witness. U.S.S.G. ยง 3C1.1 cmt. n.4(A). Because nothing keeps us from meaningfully reviewing this finding, I respectfully dissent from Part II.C. of the court's opinion.
