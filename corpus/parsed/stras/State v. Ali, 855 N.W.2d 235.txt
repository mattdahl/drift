 in part, dissenting in part).
I agree with many of the points made in Justice Page's dissent, but write separately to explain my disagreement with Part III of the court's opinion. The Legislature has stated in clear and unambiguous terms: "The court shall sentence a person to life imprisonment without possibility of release" for a conviction of first-degree premeditated murder. Minn. Stat. § 609.106, subd. 2 (2012). The entire court agrees that the mandatory LWOR  sentence prescribed by the Legislature is unconstitutional with respect to juveniles like Mahdi Ali under Miller v. Alabama,     U.S.    , 132 S. Ct. 2455, 2460, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012),1  but we disagree about the proper remedy.
It is well established that the judiciary does not write statutes; nor do we amend them, no matter the circumstances. See, e.g., Axelberg v. Comm'r of Pub. Safety, 848 N.W.2d 206, 213 (Minn. 2014); Dukowitz v. Hannon Sec. Servs., 841 N.W.2d 147, 151-54 (Minn. 2014); In re Estate of Karger, 253 Minn. 542, 548, 93 N.W.2d 137, 142 (1958). Instead, our authority is limited to the exercise of "judicial power." Minn. Const. art. III; Minn. Const. art. VI, § 1; Sanborn v. Rice Cnty. Comm'rs, 9 Minn. 273, 278, 9 Gilf. 258 (1864); see also State v. M.D.T., 831 N.W.2d 276, 284 (Minn. 2013) (Stras, J., concurring) (stating that the power of the judicial branch is limited to exercising the "judicial power"). The court presumes that the "judicial power" includes the authority to establish procedures within the courts-a proposition that finds support in State v. Chauvin, 723 N.W.2d 20 (Minn. 2006). Still, Chauvin provides, at most, only partial support for the court's preferred remedy. Even if the "judicial power" includes authority to create an ad-hoc hearing procedure to comply with Miller, it certainly does not give courts the power to amend the heinous-crimes statute,2  see Minn. Stat. § 609.106, subd. 2, to replace "shall" with "may" so that it now reads, "the court may sentence a person to life imprisonment without possibility of release," or, as the court also has done, to provide a list of substantive factors for district courts to consider in determining the appropriate sentence.3  Amending statutes is, and always has been, the Legislature's job, particularly  when it involves defining criminal offenses and establishing criminal sentences. See State v. Osterloh, 275 N.W.2d 578, 580 (Minn. 1978) ("Determination of what conduct constitutes a criminal offense and the punishment that ought to be imposed . . . is peculiarly a legislative and not a judicial function." (quoting State ex rel. Ahern v. Young, 273 Minn. 240, 243, 141 N.W.2d 15, 17 (1966))); State v. Moilen, 140 Minn. 112, 115, 167 N.W. 345, 346 (1918) ("It is the exclusive province of the Legislature to declare what acts . . . constitute a crime, to prohibit the same and impose appropriate penalties for a violation thereof.").
Squarely within the scope of "judicial power," however, is the power to sever an unconstitutional provision and enforce those remaining portions of the statute that do not violate the United States or Minnesota Constitutions. See State v. Barker, 705 N.W.2d 768, 773 (Minn. 2005); State v. Shattuck, 704 N.W.2d 131, 143 (Minn. 2005); see also State v. Melchert-Dinkel, 844 N.W.2d 13, 24 (Minn. 2014) (setting forth guidelines for determining when it is permissible to sever the unconstitutional portions of a statute). That is what the Minnesota Constitution requires us to do here. Whether phrased in terms of statutory revival or severance of the unconstitutional provisions, the remedy is the same: we must declare the heinous-crimes statute unconstitutional as applied to Ali and remand the case to the district court with instructions to impose a sentence of life with the possibility of release.
