I still harbor grave doubts about whether judges, rather than juries, can make the finding that multiple offenses were committed "on occasions different from one another" without violating the Sixth Amendment. See United States v. Perry, 908 F.3d 1126, 1134-36 (8th Cir. 2018) (Stras, J., concurring). But because the court's opinion is consistent with binding circuit precedent, I concur.
