I join the court's opinion because I agree that Missouri's tied-house statute fails the Central Hudson test. Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980); 1-800-411-Pain Referral Serv., LLC v. Otto, 744 F.3d 1045, 1055 (8th Cir. 2014) (explaining that Central Hudson applies to restrictions on commercial speech). But I cannot help but wonder whether we should be applying a different standard. After all, Central Hudson fits best when a law limits commercial speech, see Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 571-72, not when it does something more.
Missouri's tied-house statute does more than just limit speech. To be sure, as Missouri has interpreted it, the statute forbids manufacturers from mentioning retailers in their advertisements. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 311.070.1. But this general prohibition does not apply if manufacturers: (1) list more than one, (2) make the listing of retailers "inconspicuous," and (3) do not advertise prices. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 311.070.4(10). Together, these two provisions compel associational speech by treating a manufacturer's "choice to talk about one [of its retailers] as a trigger for compelling [it] to talk about" another. Telescope Media Grp. v. Lucero, 936 F.3d 740, 753 (8th Cir. 2019). In these circumstances, a stricter standard should—and arguably does—apply.
Janus suggests as much. See Janus v. Am. Fed'n of State, Cty., & Mun. Emps., Council 31, 138 S. Ct. 2448, 2464-65, 201 L. Ed. 2d 924 (2018). There, the Supreme Court explained that exacting scrutiny—not Central Hudson—applies if a law requires the bankrolling of someone else's commercial speech. See id. at 2465 (noting that this standard requires "a compelling state interest that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms" (quoting Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, Local 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 310, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 183 L. Ed. 2d 281 (2012))). Yet even exacting scrutiny might not be exacting enough for Missouri's statute, which forces manufacturers to alter their own message. Cf. Glickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457, 470-71, 117 S. Ct. 2130, 138 L. Ed. 2d 585 (1997) (reasoning that  true compelled speech can be even more insidious than compelled funding of speech); Telescope Media Grp., 936 F.3d at 751-54 (applying strict scrutiny to a law that compelled for-profit, non-commercial speech). In an appropriate case, if the issue were briefed, I would be open to deciding whether Central Hudson is actually the right fit for cases like this one.
