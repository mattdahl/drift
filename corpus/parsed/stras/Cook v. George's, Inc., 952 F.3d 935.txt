The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against a "qualified individual": someone "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions" of a job. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8), 12112(a). To plead this statutory element, Jerry Cook had to include  enough facts in his complaint to show that he was "qualified" for the job he sought. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) ("To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). "[N]aked assertion[s]" and "formulaic recitation[s] of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Id. (citations omitted).
Cook's complaint in this case fails to get out of the starting gate. All it says is that the "[p]laintiff and the Class able [sic] to do his job with reasonable accommodations." It does not state which job, if any, he previously held with the company, nor does it mention which job he applied for this time around. Without this basic information, we cannot know the "essential functions" of the job, much less how he could have performed them. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). All we have is a conclusory assertion lacking even a single fact in support.
There is, to be sure, no question that Cook believes that he was "qualified," or he would not have said that he was "able" to do the "job." But mere belief, coupled with a leap of faith, cannot survive a motion to dismiss. See Hager v. Ark. Dep't of Health, 735 F.3d 1009, 1014-15 (8th Cir. 2013) (explaining that a discrimination complaint must contain enough factual allegations to "raise a right to relief above the speculative level" (citation omitted)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).
I recognize that the district court did not dismiss Cook's complaint because he failed to allege facts in support of this particular element. Even so, Cook had the burden of pleading enough to show that he was "qualified," which is a threshold statutory requirement; the allegations here are not only inadequate, but woefully inadequate; and we may affirm on "any basis supported by the record," Fullington v. Pfizer, Inc., 720 F.3d 739, 747 (8th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted) (affirming the grant of a motion to dismiss on an alternative, unargued ground).
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
