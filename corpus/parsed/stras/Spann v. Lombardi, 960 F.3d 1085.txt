, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
The court affirms a discretionary call that I am not sure the district court actually made. I cannot tell whether it declined to address qualified immunity at summary judgment because of inadequate briefing, inadequate pleading, or something else entirely, so I would remand the whole case. See Payne v. Britten, 749 F.3d 697, 699, 701 (8th Cir. 2014); see also H & R Block Tax Servs. LLC v. Acevedo-Lopez, 742 F.3d 1074, 1078 (8th Cir. 2014) (remanding when the basis for the district court's discretionary decision was unclear).
