, dissenting.
The district court said everything it needed to say when it denied Nyles Earlmondo Johnson's motion. See First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194. It first explained that Johnson was eligible for a sentence reduction. See United States v. McDonald, 944 F.3d 769, 771-72 (8th Cir. 2019). It then said it was denying one because of the specific circumstances surrounding Johnson's plea agreement. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C). At that point, there was nothing else to say.
The court concludes otherwise based on the possibility that the district court may have thought that it lacked discretion. It is true that, in the course of its analysis, the district court discussed another type of sentence-reduction motion. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3582(c)(2); see also Hughes v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1765, 201 L. Ed. 2d 72 (2018). But then it focused on the facts of this case and described why a reduction would require too much "conjecture" about the reasons behind the "the agreed[-upon] sentence" in Johnson's plea agreement. It is not our place to disturb this conclusion, United States v. Williams, 943 F.3d 841, 844 (8th Cir. 2019) (requiring only "a reasoned basis for [the district court's] decision"), and certainly not so the district court can simply clean up a few sentences in what is an "otherwise thorough" 20-page order.2 Ante at 3. I respectfully dissent.
