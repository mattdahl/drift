The court's approach in addressing Perry's past crimes, and in particular whether he committed them "on occasions different from one another," falls in line with our cases but is a departure from fundamental Sixth Amendment principles. I join the court's opinion because it is a faithful application of existing circuit precedent, but I write separately to express my concerns about what is, in my view, an erosion of the jury-trial right. See U.S. Const. amend. VI ("In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . .").
The relevant facts here are simple. Years ago, Perry fired a warning shot at a witness after robbing a gas station. Thanks to the arcane workings of the Armed Career Criminal Act, he now faces a ten-year maximum sentence for each of his most recent convictions if the shot and the robbery happened on the same "occasion," but a fifteen-year mandatory minimum with no upper limit if they happened on different "occasions." 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2), (e)(1).
The constitutional standard is simple too. "Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000); see also Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. 99, 103, 133 S. Ct. 2151, 186 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2013) (holding that "any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is [also] an 'element' that must be submitted to the jury").
Simple facts and simple law should lead to a simple conclusion. A finding that Perry committed his past crimes on different occasions exposes him to a longer sentence, so the jury should make the finding, not the court. To be sure, the Supreme Court has carved out an exception allowing district courts to find "the fact of a prior conviction." Alleyne, 570 U.S. at 111 n.1; Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 489; see also Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1998). But the exception is "narrow," Alleyne, 570 U.S. at 111 n.1, and permits the court to "do no more . . . than determine what crime, with what elements, the defendant was convicted of," Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2252, 195 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2016).
The district court did much more here. Determining whether Perry committed his robbery and assaults on separate occasions is not just a straightforward matter of identifying the crimes he committed. Rather, it requires closely examining what he did to commit each offense, when and where he did it, and what he did in between. The court must then weigh "at least three factors"—the timing, location, and "overall substantive continuity" of the crimes, plus whatever else might be relevant in a particular case—in a context-specific balancing test that we still struggle to put into words. United States v. Willoughby, 653 F.3d 738, 742-43 (8th Cir. 2011); see also, e.g., Levering v. United States, 890 F.3d 738, 740 (8th Cir. 2018) (lamenting that an attempted reformulation of what counts as an "occasion" just "raise[d] more questions"). This analysis crosses the line from "identifying the crime[s] of conviction" into the forbidden territory of "explor[ing] the manner in which the defendant committed th[e] offense[s]." Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2252.
Nonetheless, our cases steadfastly insist that judges can make the heavily fact-dependent different-occasions determination because it is "among the recidivism-related facts" exempt from the general rule. United States v. Harris, 794 F.3d 885, 887  (8th Cir. 2015); accord, e.g., United States v. Evans, 738 F.3d 935, 936 (8th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (citing United States v. Ramsey, 498 F. App'x 653, 654 (8th Cir. 2013) (unpublished per curiam)). But there is no such exception, at least as far as the Supreme Court is concerned. There is just the one unique fact that courts may find: "the simple fact of a prior conviction." Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2252.
Indeed, if all facts having some relationship to recidivism were exempt from the Sixth Amendment, then the leading ACCA cases would not contain the reasoning that they do. In Mathis, the fact at issue was whether the location of a previous burglary was a building or a vehicle, id. at 2250; in Descamps v. United States, it was whether the defendant had entered a store legally or illegally, 570 U.S. 254, 259, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 186 L. Ed. 2d 438 (2013). Those facts were no less "recidivism-related" than whether Perry committed his back-to-back crimes on different occasions. Yet the opinions in both cases emphasized that letting a court find them "would raise serious Sixth Amendment concerns." Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2252; Descamps, 570 U.S. at 269.
I acknowledge that our approach of permitting a judge to make the different-occasions determination puts us in good company. See United States v. Blair, 734 F.3d 218, 228 (3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases from most other circuits). The predominant explanation resembles our own. Most courts reason that the when and where of a past crime is inseparable from the fact of conviction, so the prior-conviction exception covers them too. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 421 F.3d 278, 286 (4th Cir. 2005) ("To take notice of the different dates or locations of burglaries—something inherent in the conviction—is to take notice of different occasions of burglary as a matter of law."); United States v. Burgin, 388 F.3d 177, 186 (6th Cir. 2004).
Inertia may be part of the explanation. Sometimes courts just continue along the same well-trodden path even in the face of clear signs to turn around. We have missed more than a few bread crumbs leading away. The Supreme Court has all but announced that an expansive view of the prior-conviction exception is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment.
First, in Alleyne, the Court characterized the prior-conviction exception as "narrow." 570 U.S. at 111 n.1. Then in Descamps, the Court rejected an approach allowing district courts to look at the records of a prior conviction to determine "what [a] defendant actually did," because it would extend "judicial factfinding beyond the recognition of a prior conviction." 570 U.S. at 268-69. And finally, there simply is no way to square an expansive view of the prior-conviction exception with Mathis, which left little doubt that a finding of whether a burglary involved a building or a vehicle—in other words, the location of the crime—cannot be treated the same as the fact of a prior conviction. 136 S. Ct. at 2252. Yet most courts, even after Alleyne, Descamps, and Mathis, assign judges the role of finding even more facts—including the timing, location, and nature of multiple convictions—in search of an answer to the vexing different-occasions question.
A misunderstanding of the permissible uses of Shepard documents may also account for the predominant view. Some courts claim that there is no Sixth Amendment problem as long as courts limit themselves to facts taken from charging documents, plea agreements, and comparable materials—more commonly known as Shepard documents. See, e.g., United States v. King, 853 F.3d 267, 273 (6th Cir. 2017); see also Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2005); Taylor v. United  States, 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990). "[R]epurpos[ing]" Taylor and Shepard to justify judicial fact-finding, however, turns those decisions on their heads. Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2254.
Taylor serves as the starting point for the "categorical" approach in ACCA cases, the whole point of which (as the Court has repeatedly reminded us) is to analyze the legal elements of past crimes, not their underlying facts. See 495 U.S. at 600; see also, e.g., Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2248; Descamps, 570 U.S. at 261. Taylor also answered the practical question of how to determine a defendant's crime (and thus what legal elements to analyze) when a criminal statute defines more than one offense. See 495 U.S. at 602. The answer, according to the Court, is to allow district courts to review a limited set of documents to identify the actual offense of conviction. See id. Shepard, for its part, merely reaffirmed Taylor's approach and supplemented its list of acceptable documents to cover cases in which a prior conviction follows a guilty plea rather than a trial. See 544 U.S. at 20-21, 23.
Shepard documents accordingly serve a specific and narrow function; they are not an excuse for allowing courts to dig through the record to find facts. To the contrary, properly used, they do not support fact-finding at all. The Court made that abundantly clear in Descamps by prohibiting judges from "look[ing] to reliable materials (the charging document, jury instructions, plea colloquy, and so forth) to determine what facts [could] confidently be thought to underlie the defendant's conviction." 570 U.S. at 265-66 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). The reason, the Court explained, is that when there is no need to choose between multiple possible crimes, Shepard documents simply "ha[ve] no role to play." Id. at 264.
The approach the Court rejected in Descamps is not meaningfully different from using Shepard documents to make the different-occasions determination. Both call for sifting through record materials for evidence of what a defendant actually did, either to determine whether it fits the definition of a violent felony, see id. at 259-60, or to determine if two or more crimes were committed on different occasions, see King, 853 F.3d at 274. If one improperly "convert[s] [the categorical] approach into its opposite," Descamps, 570 U.S. at 274, so does the other.
* * *
What the district court did in this case is "just what [the Supreme Court] ha[s] said it cannot" do. Id. at 270. But it is also what we have expressly and repeatedly instructed district courts they should do. See Harris, 794 F.3d at 887 (after Descamps); Evans, 738 F.3d at 936 (same). I reluctantly concur.
