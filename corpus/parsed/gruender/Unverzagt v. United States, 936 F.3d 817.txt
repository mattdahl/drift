, concurring in the judgment.
While I concur in the judgment, I would first conclude that the sentencing record is silent before considering the background legal environment. See Golinveaux v. United States, 915 F.3d 564, 568 (8th Cir. 2019) (explaining that the relevant inquiry considers first the sentencing record and that the "second step is to determine the relevant legal environment"). Here, I take Unverzagt's statement that "the record is silent" to mean that the sentencing record is silent. It seems clear that he is not referring to the post-conviction record by making such a concession because the sentencing record is what is relevant to our analysis.
After concluding that the record is silent, I would then affirm the district court because, as the court's analysis shows, the background legal environment makes clear that Unverzagt has not shown that it is "more likely than not" that he was sentenced under the residual clause. See Walker v. United States, 900 F.3d 1012, 1014-15 (8th Cir. 2018) ("Where the record or an evidentiary hearing is inconclusive, the district court may consider 'the relevant  background legal environment at the time of . . . sentencing' to ascertain whether the movant was sentenced under the residual clause.").
