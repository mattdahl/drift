, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the court's judgment and join part I of the court's opinion. I write separately because I would follow the Supreme Court's lead, refuse to extend Bivens, and leave it to Congress to create any new cause of action. See Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857, 198 L. Ed. 2d 290 (2017). Thus, Stanko lacks claims under ยง 1983 and Bivens, and the court need not discuss his failure to exhaust tribal court remedies. Indeed, the court's statement that the second Montana exception "unquestionably" applies, ante at 7, risks undermining Supreme Court precedent limiting its scope, see, e.g., Plains Comm. Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co., 554 U.S. 316, 330, 128 S. Ct. 2709, 171 L. Ed. 2d 457 (2008); Strate v. A-1 Contrs., 520 U.S. 438, 456-59, 117 S. Ct. 1404, 137 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1997). Accordingly, I would refrain from addressing the complicated issues surrounding tribal court jurisdiction, which are not necessary to resolve the case.
