, dissenting.
The court affirms the district court's denial of qualified immunity to Officer Wallace regarding Chestnut's unlawful detention and arrest claim, holding that Wallace  violated Chestnut's clearly established right "to watch police-citizen interactions at a distance and without interference." Supra, at 7. I respectfully disagree. Wallace's questioning and detention of Chestnut was not objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law. Officer Wallace is thus entitled to qualified immunity.
I.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed that "qualified immunity protects 'all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'" See, e.g., Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308, 193 L. Ed. 2d 255 (2015) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1986)). In analyzing whether a right was clearly established at the time of the incident, "the dispositive question is whether there was a fair and clear warning of what the Constitution requires." Thompson v. City of Monticello, 894 F.3d 993, 1000 (8th Cir. 2018). While a "general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question," Rokusek v. Jansen, 899 F.3d 544, 548 (8th Cir. 2018), "clearly established law" may not be defined "at a high level of generality," White v. Pauly, 580 U.S. ---, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552, 196 L. Ed. 2d 463 (2017) (per curiam). It is the plaintiff's burden to demonstrate that the law is clearly established. See Morgan v. Robinson, 920 F.3d 521, 524 (8th Cir. 2019) (en banc).
In the Fourth Amendment context, whether a right was clearly established at the time the defendant acted requires an assessment of whether the official's conduct would have been objectively unreasonable at the time of the incident. Waters v. Madson, 921 F.3d 725, 734-35 (8th Cir. 2019); Turner v. Lieutenant Driver, 848 F.3d 678, 691 (5th Cir. 2017). Courts must ask whether the law so clearly and unambiguously prohibited the conduct that "every 'reasonable official would [have understood] that what he is doing violates'" the law. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (2011) (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987)). This instruction means that "clearly established law must be 'particularized' to the facts of the case," White, 137 S. Ct. at 552 (quoting Anderson 483 U.S. at 640), and the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that factual "specificity is especially important in the Fourth Amendment context, where . . . it is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine . . . will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts," Mullenix, 136 S. Ct. at 308 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).
An officer may conduct an investigative stop and brief detention when he "observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot." United States v. Dortch, 868 F.3d 674, 678 (8th Cir. 2017). To determine whether an investigative stop is reasonable, we examine "whether the officer's action was justified at its inception" and "whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place." Wilson v. Lamp, 901 F.3d 981, 986 (8th Cir. 2018) (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19-20, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968)). "While reasonable suspicion must be more than an inchoate hunch, the Fourth Amendment only requires that police articulate some minimal, objective justification for an investigatory stop." United States v. Riley, 684 F.3d 758, 763 (8th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). If we determine that an officer lacked reasonable suspicion, he "may nonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity if [he] had arguable reasonable  suspicion—that is, if a reasonable officer in the same position could have believed [he] had reasonable suspicion." Waters, 921 F.3d at 736.
The court first finds that Wallace violated Chestnut's Fourth Amendment right to be free from detention absent reasonable suspicion. Supra, at 7. According to the court, this is because Walker v. City of Pine Bluff, 414 F.3d 989 (8th Cir. 2005), established that no reasonable officer could have suspected that Chestnut had committed or was about to commit a crime because Chestnut had a right to observe police conduct. But to reach its conclusion that Wallace acted unreasonably, the majority defines the right at a high level of generality, ignoring the arguable reasonableness of Wallace's actions under the circumstances. Viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances, I do not believe that Officer Wallace's actions violated law clearly established by Walker or any other case.
In Walker, we concluded that police acted unreasonably when they arrested John Walker, an individual who, while observing police at a traffic stop, "stood at a considerable distance from police officers," "spoke only when spoken to," and "complied with [the officer's] request for identification." Walker, 414 F.3d at 993. Notably, Walker only observed one traffic stop, he did not follow an officer in the dark, he was accompanied by his daughter and two grandchildren, and he stood across the street in view of the officers. Id. at 992. In response, the police handcuffed him, kept him in a hot patrol car for twenty minutes, and then drove him to the police station. Id. We determined that the police violated clearly established law because no officer could have believed he had probable cause to arrest Walker for obstructing police operations or for any other crime. Id. at 993.
The facts in this case differ materially. At 5:57 p.m. on February 6, 2015, Officer Wallace heard Officer Leviya Graham radio dispatch for backup on her patrol. Chestnut's stipulated statement of the undisputed facts includes a transcript of that call, which provides that Officer Graham informed other officers that she had a "suspicious person" "standing across the street" and "leaning up against a tree" who was "following [her] to all [of her] car stops." She requested an "assist"—a term officers testified meant that she needed another officer to investigate because she could not handle the situation alone. Officer Graham had been followed by a male suspect from stop to stop once before in the neighborhood, resulting in an arrest after the man became belligerent, and the neighborhood was also one in which police had recently faced violent attacks. Wallace reacted quickly, arriving at Tower Grove Park at roughly 6:00 p.m., within minutes of Graham's call.
Upon arriving at the scene, Wallace observed Chestnut standing under a tree in the park, watching Officer Graham. Because it was almost completely dark, he aimed his spotlight at Chestnut.2  Wallace  then approached Chestnut to investigate further. When Chestnut said he did not have identification, Wallace asked him to provide other identifying information, including his Social Security Number. Chestnut refused, and Wallace frisked Chestnut. Wallace did not find a weapon, but he ordered the other officers, who by then had arrived at the scene, to place Chestnut in handcuffs. Chestnut then asked to speak with a supervisor, and as they waited for the supervisor to arrive, he eventually provided his Social Security Number. Approximately ten minutes into the encounter, Sergeant Fred Lathan, the supervisor on duty, arrived and spoke with Chestnut for five to eight minutes. By then, Wallace had completed a warrant search, and Sergeant Lathan ordered the officers to release Chestnut. The entire encounter lasted less than twenty minutes and the officers never moved Chestnut from the location where they found him.
It is hard to blame Wallace for "missing the parallel" between Walker and this case; I do not see it either. Cf. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742. In sum, Wallace received a suspicious-person call from a female officer suggesting a male suspect had followed her to all of her car stops on a winter night through a park in an area that had recently experienced police violence. In response, he conducted a brief investigative stop to determine whether Chestnut presented a threat to officer safety. He did not move Chestnut, place him in his squad car, or drive him to the police station. Thus, Walker—a case where police arrested an individual who they observed pause on the street with his family to observe a single traffic stop—does not provide obvious guidance for this case.
As we stated in Walker, whether an officer has reason to investigate an on-looker is a "complex" question because "some on-lookers may create safety hazards, while others may seek to frustrate valid law enforcement." Walker, 414 F.3d at 993. This acknowledged complexity must mean that there are times when police are justified in investigating an individual who observes their conduct. Though we "do not require a case directly on point" for a right to be clearly established, Mullenix, 136 S. Ct. at 308, Walker is "too factually distinct to speak clearly to the specific circumstances here," id. at 312, and it "shed[s] little light on whether the far greater danger" of an individual potentially stalking an officer by following her from stop to stop at nightfall is sufficiently threatening to warrant a reasonable suspicion of criminality—itself a less stringent standard than the arguable probable cause required to justify the officers' actions in Walker. See id.
The court does not explain why the distinctions between this case and Walker fail to sufficiently distinguish it. Instead, it says it is unconvinced by Wallace's attempt to do so. Supra, at 7. Yet Wallace does not bear the burden to show that these cases are too distinct to provide obvious guidance; Chestnut has the burden to prove they are sufficiently similar. See Morgan, 920 F.3d at 524. We cannot—and should not—shift that burden. In light of the dissimilarities in these cases, I do not believe that Walker put "beyond debate" what the law required in the circumstances Wallace faced. See al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741.
In an effort to support its finding that Wallace violated clearly established law,  the court turns away from Walker to an argument Chestnut does not advance: that a consensus of cases from other circuits establishing that the Constitution protects those who video record police activity as long as they do not interfere with police duties also includes the right to merely observe police conduct. Supra, at 8-9. I agree with the court's characterization of those cases. But—again—the fact that a certain right exists does not mean it is without limits, nor does it necessarily indicate that it is obvious how the right applies to a certain set of facts. Turner v. Lieutenant Driver, 848 F.3d 678 (5th Cir. 2017), a recent Fifth Circuit case considering the right to record the police, illustrates that factual distinctions matter greatly in delimiting the right. There, officers observed an individual videotaping the Fort Worth Police Station from a sidewalk across the street from the station. Id. at 683. Officers approached, questioned, and detained the on-looker, eventually handcuffing him and placing him in the back of a patrol car. Id. The court found that, because of the unusual nature of where and what he was recording, "[a]n objectively reasonable person in [the officers'] position could have suspected that Turner was casing the station for an attack, stalking an officer, or otherwise preparing for criminal activity, and thus could have found Turner's filming of the 'routine activities' of the station sufficiently suspicious to warrant questioning and a brief detention." Id. at 692 (emphasis added).
Likewise, under the circumstances presented here, a reasonable officer could believe it would not violate clearly established law to conduct an investigative stop. Officer Graham's call suggested Chestnut was more than merely a passive on-looker "observing police officers at work." Supra, at 11. Quite differently, he was following her into the night as she made her stops.3  See United States v. Ortiz-Monroy, 332 F.3d 525, 529 (8th Cir. 2003) ("[A]n officer may rely on information provided by other officers and all the information known to a team of officers . . . to provide justification for a stop."). Wallace stated that he too found Chestnut's behavior suspicious because, in his experience, individuals who are merely interested in police conduct generally make their presence more apparent and do not follow officers from stop to stop. See United States v. Beck, 140 F.3d 1129, 1136 (8th Cir. 1998) ("We may consider any added meaning certain conduct might suggest to experienced officers trained in the arts of observation and crime detection and acquainted with operating modes of criminals."). And Chestnut's location in a  neighborhood where police had recently faced violent attacks reinforced the officers' concerns.4  See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S. Ct. 673, 145 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2000) (noting that it is reasonable for an officer to consider "the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation").
The court determines that Chestnut's conduct suggested he was just as likely to be a "casual observer" as he was to be "a threatening presence." Supra, at 11. Sure, he followed a police officer from stop to stop on a winter night through a dark park, but that alone is not criminal. Neither is his presence along the darkened treeline. After all, one man's shadowy treeline is another man's shade tree. But that Chestnut's conduct was susceptible to innocent explanation is not determinative of whether a reasonable officer could have suspected he intended harm. Even a combination of innocent conduct can suffice to support a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. See Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 125 (explaining that even in Terry, the conduct at issue—walking on the sidewalk and pausing repeatedly in front of a storefront window—was "lawful" and "susceptible to innocent explanation," but when viewed from the perspective of an experienced officer, this repetitive action "also suggested that the individuals were casing the store for a planned robbery").
"While reasonable suspicion must be more than an inchoate hunch, the Fourth Amendment only requires that police articulate some minimal, objective justification for an investigatory stop." Riley, 684 F.3d at 763 (internal quotation marks omitted). Examining the totality of the circumstances, I cannot say that Wallace's initial questioning and detention of Chestnut was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law. See Waters, 921 F.3d at 736.
II.
That Wallace did not violate clearly established law by deciding to conduct an investigative stop does not fully resolve our inquiry. Chestnut also argues that El-Ghazzawy v. Berthiaume, 636 F.3d 452 (8th Cir. 2011), confirms that even if Wallace had a reasonable suspicion to stop him, Wallace violated the Fourth Amendment by frisking, handcuffing, and prolonging his detention because the manner in which the stop was conducted was unreasonable. We determine whether an initially reasonable investigative stop became unreasonable by examining whether the officer's investigation was "excessively intrusive in its scope or manner of execution," El-Ghazzawy, 636 F.3d at 457, looking to factors such as whether the stop lasted an unreasonably long time or whether officers used unreasonable force, United States v. Newell, 596 F.3d 876, 879 (8th Cir. 2010).
Here, the duration of the stop was not objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law because Chestnut contributed to any delay. Chestnut requested to speak to a supervisor, and a reasonable police officer in that situation could believe that waiting for the supervisor to arrive at the scene did not transform Chestnut's  detention into a de facto arrest. See Cady v. Sheahan, 467 F.3d 1057, 1063 (7th Cir. 2006) (noting that plaintiff's refusal to provide identification, request to speak with a supervisor, and extended discussion with law enforcement regarding court precedent extended stop—not law enforcement's investigatory measures).
Chestnut also prolonged the stop by refusing to provide identifying information, preventing officers from verifying his identity and determining whether he had any outstanding warrants. See Waters, 921 F.3d at 737 (finding twenty-minute detention reasonable when suspect refused to identify himself). While the court suggests that this should not have factored into Wallace's suspicions because Chestnut had a right to refuse to answer all of Wallace's questions, supra, at 5, "[t]he totality-of-the-circumstances test precludes this sort of divide-and-conquer analysis," United States v. Collins, 883 F.3d 1029, 1031 (8th Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is true that a refusal to identify oneself, "without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure," Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 125 (emphasis added) (quoting Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 437, 111 S. Ct. 2382, 115 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1991)), but where officers already possess "articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a criminal offense, that person may be stopped in order to identify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him briefly while attempting to obtain additional information," Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Ct. of Nev., 542 U.S. 177, 186, 124 S. Ct. 2451, 159 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2004) (quoting Hayes v. Florida, 470 U.S. 811, 816, 105 S. Ct. 1643, 84 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1985)). An objectively reasonable officer could have believed it was lawful to continue to detain Chestnut in light of his refusal to provide requested identifying information and his demand to speak with a supervisor.
Next, Chestnut argues that Officer Wallace's decision to handcuff him was unnecessarily intrusive because, after he frisked him, Wallace knew Chestnut was unarmed. This is a closer question, but I ultimately conclude Wallace's decision was not objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.5  Chestnut again both overstates our holding and misstates our analysis in El-Ghazzawy.
In El-Ghazzawy, this court denied qualified immunity to an officer, who, after immediately arriving at a suspected crime scene, handcuffed the suspect without any investigation. 636 F.3d at 454-55. There, we relied not only on the fact that the officer had no indication that the suspect was armed but also considered that the suspected crime did not necessarily involve a weapon, the suspect exhibited no suspicious behavior and cooperated with officers throughout the incident, the officer failed to conduct any investigation before handcuffing the suspect, and no exigent circumstances existed to justify handcuffing the suspect since the suspected crime had already occurred and evidence was in police possession. Id. at 457-58; see also Waters, 921 F.3d at 737-38 (identifying the five factors on which the El-Ghazzawy court relied). Indeed, contrary to Chestnut's  claims, this circuit and others have emphasized that some circumstances may justify a brief handcuffing even after a search has demonstrated the suspect is not armed. See, e.g., Waters, 921 F.3d at 732, 737-38; El-Ghazzawy, 636 F.3d at 457 ("[F]or the use of handcuffs during a Terry stop, the Fourth Amendment requires some reasonable belief that the suspect is armed and dangerous or that the restraints are necessary for some other legitimate purpose, evaluated on the facts of each case."); United States v. Bailey, 743 F.3d 322, 340 (2d Cir. 2014) ("[T]he government may be able to point to circumstances supporting a reasonable basis to think that even an unarmed person poses a present physical threat or flight risk warranting handcuffing.").
Here, Wallace testified that he thought Chestnut could be a threat even if he did not have a weapon on his person, and he concluded that a brief handcuffing would be best for both his and Chestnut's safety while he and other officers investigated. Given what Wallace knew, his safety concern was not unreasonable, and he did not violate clearly established law in responding to that concern by concluding that a brief handcuffing was "reasonably necessary . . . to maintain the status quo" while officers worked in a dark park to identify Chestnut. Waters, 921 F.3d at 737. Importantly, Wallace did not move Chestnut, place him in a patrol car, or drive him to the police station. Cf. Walker, 414 F.3d at 992. Although others may have concluded a brief handcuffing was unnecessary under the circumstances, in evaluating Fourth Amendment reasonableness, "[t]he question is not simply whether some other alternative was available, but whether the police acted unreasonably in failing to recognize or to pursue it." United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 687, 105 S. Ct. 1568, 84 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1985). I cannot say that only someone "plainly incompetent" or who "knowingly violate[s] the law" would have acted as Wallace did. See Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1986). Accordingly, Officer Wallace is entitled to qualified immunity.
III.
In recent years, the Supreme Court has issued several decisions reversing denials of qualified immunity by the courts of appeals. The Court found those reversals "necessary both because qualified immunity is important to society as a whole, and because as an immunity from suit, qualified immunity is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial." White, 137 S. Ct. at 551 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We should hew closely to the wisdom of this instruction and to the counsel of our own precedent which emphasizes that officers in the line of duty are not "participating in a law school seminar." Lawyer v. City of Council Bluffs, 361 F.3d 1099, 1108 (8th Cir. 2004). It is thus worth emphasizing again that police officers are not—and should not be—expected to parse fine distinctions between statutory and constitutional law in split-second decisions. See id.
Because there is no authority that would have given Officer Wallace notice that it was a Fourth Amendment violation to conduct an investigative stop in the manner he did under the circumstances presented in this case, I respectfully dissent.
