, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I concur in all aspects of the Court's opinion and judgment except part V. Because I believe the imposition of separate special assessments for multiple violations of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) is required by precedent of this Circuit, I respectfully dissent from part V of the Court's opinion.
In United States v. Peterson, 867 F.2d 1110, 1115 (8th Cir. 1989), abrogated on other grounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112, 110 S. Ct. 2301 (1990), we addressed the issue of multiplicity and firearm possession offenses under § 922(g). See United States v. Walker, 380 F.3d 391, 394 (8th Cir. 2004). Unfortunately, the facts of Peterson are not particularly clear. See United States v. Johnson, 130 F.3d 1420, 1425 n.1 (10th Cir. 1997) ("[Peterson] provides little detail concerning the facts of the case . . . [so that] it is unclear whether the (g)(3) charge was based on possession of the same firearm and at the same time as one of the (g)(1) charges."). The opinion does, however, describe evidence of Steven Peterson's illegal firearm possession collected from two separate searches. During the first search, law enforcement found a substantial quantity of illegal drugs, a .22 caliber handgun, and ammunition. The second search, conducted two days later, produced "several holsters and other weapons paraphernalia." Peterson, 867 F.2d at 1112. The opinion does not mention any firearm other than the .22 caliber handgun found during the two searches nor does it otherwise attribute another firearm to Peterson.
Based primarily on the contraband found during the two searches, Peterson was charged with and convicted of one count of being a drug user in possession of a firearm, in violation of § 922(g)(3), and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and two counts of being a felon in possession of ammunition, each in violation of § 922(g)(1). On appeal, Peterson challenged the four counts of conviction on the grounds that the charges were multiplicitious. Id. at 1115.
We affirmed all four of Peterson's firearm convictions under "the 'same elements' test of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 76 L. Ed. 306, 52 S. Ct. 180 (1932), which held that charged counts are not multiplicitous if each count requires proof of an element that the other count does not require." Walker, 380 F.3d at 394 (citing Peterson, 867 F.2d at 1115). With respect to Peterson's possession of the .22 caliber handgun in violation of § 922(g)(1) and § 922(g)(3), we held that the counts were not multiplicitous because Peterson's use of controlled substances was a separate element from his status as a convicted felon. Peterson, 867 F.2d at 1115. 4  The separate counts of conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm and being a drug user in possession of a firearm must have arisen from the only firearm, the .22 caliber handgun, discussed in the opinion. After carefully reading Peterson, I therefore conclude that it directly controls the question of whether the district court properly imposed separate special assessments for multiple violations of § 922(g) arising from a single act. 5 
 I recognize that our holding in Peterson regarding the multiplicitous nature of possession offenses under § 922(g) is in conflict with many of the other circuits. See United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 673 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Dunford, 148 F.3d 385, 389 (4th Cir. 1998); United States v. Johnson, 130 F.3d 1420, 1426 (10th Cir. 1997); United States v. Munoz-Romo, 989 F.2d 757, 759 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Winchester, 916 F.2d 601, 606 (11th Cir. 1990). However, the fact remains that in Peterson we appropriately applied the rule from Blockburger. See United States v. Bass, 794 F.2d 1305, 1308-09 (8th Cir. 1986) (applying the Blockburger test to a claim that a single act results in multiple punishment under the Omnibus Crime Control Act). Therefore, in light of our precedent and our requirement that "one panel of this court cannot overrule the decision of another," United States v. Peltier, 276 F.3d 1003, 1006 (8th Cir. 2002), I believe we are compelled to hold that § 922(g) permits multiple criminal convictions arising from the possession of a single firearm based on separate prohibitions. Accordingly, I would affirm the district court's imposition of separate special assessments for violations of § 922(g)(1) and § 922(g)(3) arising out of a single firearm possession.
