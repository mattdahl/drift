Because OCGA § 34-1-3 (a) does not forbid the discharge or discipline of an employee who, although not compelled to do so, misses work voluntarily to attend a judicial proceeding, I respectfully dissent. No one disputes that, when we construe a statute, we must search "diligently for the intention of the General Assembly." See OCGA § 1-3-1 (a). But our search for the intent of the legislature always must begin with the words of the statute, and if those words are clear and unambiguous, it also must end there, see Strength v. Lovett, 311 Ga. App. 35, 43 (2) (a) (714 SE2d 723) (2011), because, as we have explained before, we always must presume that the General Assembly meant what it said and said what it meant. Northeast Atlanta Bonding Co. v. State, 308 Ga. App. 573, 577 (1) (707 SE2d 921) (2011). This is especially true when we are construing a statute  that puts limits on the prerogative of an employer to discharge or discipline an at-will employee, for the common law recognizes no such limits, see Borden v. Johnson, 196 Ga. App. 288, 289-290 (1) (395 SE2d 628) (1990), and we must strictly construe statutes in derogation of the common law. See Brookfield Country Club, Inc. v. St. James-Brookfield, LLC, 287 Ga. 408, 411 (1) (696 SE2d 663) (2010). By its plain terms, OCGA § 34-1-3 (a) forbids the discharge or discipline of an employee for an absence only when the employee is absent "for the purpose of attending a judicial proceeding in response to a subpoena, summons for jury duty, or other court order or process which requires the attendance of the employee at the judicial proceeding." (Emphasis supplied.) So, unless an employee is required to attend a judicial proceeding, OCGA § 34-1-3 (a) does not forbid her discharge or discipline for having missed work to attend it.2 
Sonja Thomas missed work to attend a juvenile court proceeding in Tennessee, having received a subpoena issued by the authority of a Tennessee court. But Thomas is a Georgia resident with no apparent connection  to Tennessee that would subject her person to the jurisdiction of its courts, and she apparently was served with the subpoena by mail in Georgia. Consequently, the subpoena did not require Thomas to attend the hearing or, for that matter, to do anything at all,3  something that neither Thomas nor the majority disputes. For this reason, OCGA § 34-1-3 (a) simply has no application in this case.
Rather than applying the statute as written, however, the majority rewrites it to forbid the discharge or discipline of an employee who is absent from work "for the purpose of attending a judicial proceeding in response to a subpoena, summons for jury duty, or other court order or process which [reasonably appears on its face to be valid and purports to require] the attendance of the  employee at the judicial proceeding."4  Perhaps it is, for the reasons the majority gives, good policy to extend the protection of the statute so far, but we are supposed to concern ourselves with law and leave questions of policy to the General Assembly. See Robinson v. Boyd, 288 Ga. 53, 56 (2) (701 SE2d 165) (2010); Commonwealth Investment Co. v. Frye, 219 Ga. 498, 499 (134 SE2d 39) (1963). We have no authority to "rewrite statutes to promote policies that are not expressed in that legislation," Anthony v. American Gen. Financial Svcs., 287 Ga. 448, 450 (1) (a) (697 SE2d 166) (2010), and because that is precisely what the majority does today, I respectfully dissent.
