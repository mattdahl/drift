, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join all but Part II.C of the opinion of the court. As to Awnings's claim against Officer Banks, I disagree with the court's decision to declare that the claim is governed by the Due Process Clause. Whether the Fourth Amendment or the Due Process Clause governs the actions of Officer Banks during the period after Awnings  was arrested but before a judicial officer determined probable cause to detain him is important doctrinally. The issue was not thoroughly briefed in this case. The answer is unnecessary to resolving this appeal. I would therefore refrain from deciding the point.
We said in Bailey v. Feltmann, 810 F.3d 589 (8th Cir. 2016), that "this court has not resolved whether an arrestee's claim alleging denial of medical care is analyzed under the Due Process Clause or the Fourth Amendment" and noted "a conflict in authority" on the question. The Seventh Circuit draws the line at a judicial determination of probable cause: "the Fourth Amendment governs the period of confinement between arrest without a warrant and the preliminary hearing at which a determination of probable cause is made, while due process regulates the period of confinement after the initial determination of probable cause." Villanova v. Abrams, 972 F.2d 792, 797 (7th Cir. 1992); see Ortiz v. City of Chicago, 656 F.3d 523, 530 (7th Cir. 2011). On the other hand, a divided panel of the Tenth Circuit ruled that a claim based on alleged failure to prevent a detainee from committing suicide before he was taken before a magistrate judge was governed by the Due Process Clause, Barrie v. Grand Cty., 119 F.3d 862, 865-69 (10th Cir. 1997), while a concurring judge concluded that the Fourth Amendment applied. Id. at 870 (Briscoe, J., concurring).
In this case, Awnings loses under either approach. An arrestee's asserted Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable neglect in communicating a need for medical care was not clearly established in July 2013 when Awnings was seized, so Banks is entitled to qualified immunity on that claim. See Bailey, 810 F.3d at 593. If the more demanding deliberate indifference standard of the Due Process Clause applies, then Awnings's claim fails for lack of alleged conscience-shocking conduct. Ante, at 19. We need not say more to resolve the appeal.
The court goes further, however, and says that "our precedents favor analyzing Awnings's medical needs claim under Fourteenth Amendment standards." Id. But our decisions do not resolve which constitutional provision applies. As we explained in Bailey, 810 F.3d at 593, the decision in Carpenter v. Gage, 686 F.3d 644 (8th Cir. 2012), applied due process analysis to the claim of an arrestee alleging indifference to medical needs, but the plaintiff did not invoke the more favorable Fourth Amendment standard, so the issue was not joined. Id. at 650. Two earlier cases cited in Carpenter applied due process analysis, but neither suggested that the plaintiff had raised a claim of unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment and did not address that possibility. See McRaven v. Sanders, 577 F.3d 974, 979 (8th Cir. 2009); Spencer v. Knapheide Truck Equip. Co., 183 F.3d 902, 905 & n.3 (8th Cir. 1999).
The court disclaims any decision about whether "an arrestee's claim alleging denial of medical care is analyzed under the Due Process Clause or the Fourth Amendment," ante, at 19 (quoting Bailey, 810 F.3d at 593), but then decides the issue anyway as to an arrestee like Awnings. The doctrinal debate cited in Bailey concerns whether claims arising after arrest but before a judicial determination of probable cause are governed by the Fourth Amendment. Awnings's claim against Banks arose before a probable-cause determination, so the court necessarily rejects one of the two conflicting lines of authority cited in Bailey by declaring that the Due Process Clause governs Awnings's claim. I would reserve judgment on that significant question where it was not thoroughly  briefed and is unnecessary to a decision.
