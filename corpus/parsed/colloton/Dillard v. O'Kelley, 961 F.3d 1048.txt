I join the opinion of the court and submit these observations in response to the separate opinions that follow. Both opinions take the view that court decisions rejecting a plaintiff's claim of constitutional right can clearly establish a constitutional right for the benefit of a future plaintiff. The court properly declines to adopt that reasoning.
The judicial power under Article III of the Constitution is limited to resolving cases and controversies. When a court holds that a plaintiff's allegations do not establish a violation of a constitutional right, the case is resolved. The judges have no authority to bind other judges in the future to rule that some other plaintiff presenting some other set of facts would demonstrate a violation of the Constitution. "It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision." Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 399-400, 5 L. Ed. 257 (1821). So when panels of this court in Alexander v. Peffer, 993 F.2d 1348  (8th Cir. 1993), Eagle v. Morgan, 88 F.3d 620 (8th Cir. 1996), and Cooksey v. Boyer, 289 F.3d 513 (8th Cir. 2002), determined that there was no violation of a constitutional right, they could not in dicta create or recognize a clearly established right for purposes of applying the doctrine of qualified immunity in a future case. Judges do not increase their power by uttering dictum with an air of certitude.
"A judge's power to bind is limited to the issue that is before him; he cannot transmute dictum into decision by waving a wand and uttering the word 'hold.'" United States v. Rubin, 609 F.2d 51, 69 n.2 (2d Cir. 1979) (Friendly, J., concurring). If there is no decision that a constitutional right exists, then the right is not clearly established, and officials do not have fair notice about it. In the context of qualified immunity, therefore, "clearly established law comes from holdings, not dicta," Morrow v. Meachum, 917 F.3d 870, 875 (5th Cir. 2019), with the likely exception of decisions that declare a constitutional violation in a concrete case before granting qualified immunity. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009) (discussing "development of constitutional precedent" through the discretionary first step of qualified immunity analysis).
This case leaves undisturbed our precedent that a prior holding of the Eighth Circuit is sufficient to recognize a clearly established right. E.g., Chestnut v. Wallace, 947 F.3d 1085, 1090 (8th Cir. 2020); cf. City of Escondido v. Emmons, 139 S. Ct. 500, 503, 202 L. Ed. 2d 455 (2019) (per curiam) (assuming without deciding that a court of appeals decision may constitute clearly established law for purposes of qualified immunity). But in discerning a clearly established substantive due process right to informational privacy, the panel decision in this case mistakenly attributed the force of binding law to dicta in Peffer, Eagle, and Cooksey. See Dillard v. City of Springdale, 930 F.3d 935, 943-44 (8th Cir. 2019). Whether some other disclosure of information that amounted to a "shocking degradation" or "egregious humiliation" would have implicated the concept of substantive due process was unnecessary to the decision or result in those cases. It was sufficient for this court in Peffer, Eagle, and Cooksey to assume without deciding that a disclosure of matters more personal would violate the Constitution, just as it was sufficient for the Supreme Court to do so in Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599, 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1977), and NASA v. Nelson, 562 U.S. 134, 147, 131 S. Ct. 746, 178 L. Ed. 2d 667 (2011). Such an assumption does not clearly establish a constitutional right. See Nelson, 562 U.S. at 147 n.10.
Decisions of four other circuits denying qualified immunity in this context relied on precedent of that circuit deciding in an actual case that a constitutional right to informational privacy existed and was sufficiently pleaded or proved. See Sealed Plaintiff No. 1 v. Farber, 212 F. App'x 42, 43 (2d Cir. 2007) (citing Doe v. City of New York, 15 F.3d 264, 267 (2d Cir. 1994)); Anderson v. Blake, 469 F.3d 910, 914 (10th Cir. 2006) (citing Sheets v. Salt Lake County, 45 F.3d 1383, 1387-88 (10th Cir. 1995)); Sterling v. Borough of Minersville, 232 F.3d 190, 192 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing Gruenke v. Seip, 225 F.3d 290, 303 (3d Cir. 2000), and Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Philadelphia, 812 F.2d 105, 118 (3d Cir. 1987)); James v. City of Douglas, 941 F.2d 1539, 1540-41 (11th Cir. 1991) (citing Fadjo v. Coon, 633 F.2d 1172, 1175 (5th Cir. 1981)). Whatever the merit of those underlying constitutional rulings, cf. Nelson, 562 U.S. at 147 & n.10; id. at 159-68 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), the qualified  immunity decisions do not support the view that a prior decision rejecting a plaintiff's claim of right can create a clearly established right. Denius v. Dunlap, 209 F.3d 944 (7th Cir. 2000), did rely on dicta from prior decisions of that court, so it was likely incorrect on this view, as there should be no exception even for Posnerian dicta. See id. at 956-57 (citing Anderson v. Romero, 72 F.3d 518, 522 (7th Cir. 1995)).2 
The larger point about the misuse and misunderstanding of judicial dicta was well stated by Judge Leval in his Madison Lecture from October 2005. The thesis can be recounted succinctly:
We judges regularly undertake to promulgate law through utterance of dictum made to look like a holdingâ€”in disguise, so to speak. When we do so, we seek to exercise a lawmaking power that we do not rightfully possess. Also, we accept dictum uttered in a previous opinion as if it were binding law, which governs our subsequent adjudication. When we do so, we fail to discharge our responsibility to deliberate on and decide the question which needs to be decided.
Pierre N. Leval, Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta about Dicta, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1249, 1250 (2006). Given the conflicting views exhibited in this case about how binding law is decreed, and how clearly established rights are recognized, the Leval thesis and Chief Justice Marshall's teaching in Cohens warrant the renewed attention of the court.
