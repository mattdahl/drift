, concurring.
I concur in the per curiam opinion based on circuit precedent, but I believe that Keiran v. Home Capital, Inc., 720 F.3d 721 (8th Cir. 2013), was wrongly decided, see id. at 731 (Murphy, J., dissenting); Sherzer v. Homestar Mortg. Servs.., 707 F.3d 255 (3d Cir. 2013), and I would reverse the judgment of the district court if the question presented were open in this circuit.
