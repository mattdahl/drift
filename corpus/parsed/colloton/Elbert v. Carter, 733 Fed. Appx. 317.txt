, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I conclude that the panel majority, in reversing part of the district court's judgment, errs by overlooking an aspect of the doctrine of claim preclusion that justifies the district court's ruling. I would affirm the judgment.
In a prior lawsuit, Richard Elbert brought several federal constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the First and Fourth Amendments, as incorporated against the States, based on an episode at the Kansas City Apollo Country Club on December 10, 2011. The complaint alleged multiple federal claims against Detective Robert Gibbs of the Kansas City Police Department and one federal claim against Kansas City police officers named Cote and Johnson. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all claims, and this court affirmed. Elbert v. City of Kansas City, 667 F. App'x 881 (8th Cir. 2016) (per curiam). During the prior lawsuit, Elbert  also moved for leave to amend his complaint to bring claims against the same twenty-one police officers whom he sued in this action. The proposed amendment would have substituted the twenty-one officers for "John Doe" defendants named in the original complaint. The district court denied the motion for leave as untimely, and this court affirmed the denial. Id. at 883.
In this action, Elbert brought new federal and state law claims against Gibbs and the twenty-one other police officers, described as "former Doe defendants." The majority rules that the district court erred in dismissing the claims "against the former Doe defendants set forth in Counts 4, 6, and 7."
Those counts raise a question about what is known in the jargon of civil procedure as "nonmutual claim preclusion." The twenty-one police officers were not defendants in Elbert I, because the district court denied Elbert's untimely motion to add them as parties. Their invocation of claim preclusion against Elbert in this case is therefore "nonmutual."
The majority approaches this problem by asking whether the twenty-one new defendants are in "privity" with Detective Gibbs and police officers Cote and Johnson. The old and new defendants might not have the substantive legal relationships that would place them in "privity" in the traditional sense of the term, but that conclusion does not resolve this dispute. "[T]he term 'privity' . . . has also come to be used more broadly, as a way to express the conclusion that nonparty preclusion is appropriate on any ground." Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 894 n.8, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2008). See also Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793, 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1996) ("[T]he term 'privity' is now used to describe various relationships between litigants that would not have come within the traditional definition of that term."); Bruszewski v. United States, 181 F.2d 419, 423 (3d Cir. 1950) (Goodrich, J., concurring) ("Privity states no reason for including or excluding one from the estoppel of a judgment. It is merely a word used to say that the relationship between the one who is a party on the record and another is close enough to include that other within the res judicata.").
After surveying the law in this area, Professor Cooper observed that the one "cogent argument in favor of nonmutual claim preclusion is that the party to be precluded should have joined his new adversary in the original litigation." 18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4464.1, at 702 (3d ed. 2017) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). This principle of federal common law has been accepted by courts of appeals for more than a half century. In Gambocz v. Yelencsics, 468 F.2d 837 (3d Cir. 1972), the court ruled that claim preclusion barred a plaintiff, whose claim of civil conspiracy against one set of defendants in a first action was dismissed on the merits, from bringing a second action alleging the same conspiracy against additional defendants who were not parties to the first. Although the two sets of defendants were not in "privity" as the majority defines it here, the court in Gambocz reasoned that "the relationship of the additional parties to the second complaint was so close to parties to the first that the second complaint was merely a repetition of the first cause of action." Id. at 842. The court thus held the claim in the second action barred by claim preclusion and its 1950 precedent in Bruszewski, 181 F.2d 419.
This court applied the reasoning of Gambocz in Fowler v. Wolff, 479 F.2d 338 (8th Cir. 1973) (per curiam). There, a  plaintiff brought a civil rights action alleging that three Nebraska officials violated his constitutional rights. The district court dismissed the action on the merits, discussing the plaintiff's claim that the defendants infringed his rights by paroling him from prison rather than releasing him outright. The plaintiff then brought a later action for damages against two of the same defendants and two different Nebraska officials. The later action alleged that the defendants violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights by paroling him rather than releasing him, and also by revoking his parole without a hearing. This court, citing Gambocz, affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims against the two new defendants, explaining that "the relationship of [the two new defendants] to the parties sued in the [previous] action is so close that their addition cannot change the fact that this present action is repetitious and barred by res judicata." Id. at 340. Although the later action involved new individual defendants and, apparently, a new claim that was not discussed by the district court in the previous action, this court concluded that claim preclusion applied.
Since Fowler, other circuits have followed this approach and concurred with Professor Cooper's observation that "[t]he best probable outcome" is a "limited rule" that permits nonmutual claim preclusion "if the new party can show good reasons why he should have been joined in the first action and the old party cannot show any good reasons to justify a second chance." 18A Wright & Miller § 4464.1, at 709; see Mars Inc. v. Nippon Conlux Kabushiki-Kaisha, 58 F.3d 616, 620 (Fed. Cir. 1995); In re El San Juan Hotel Corp., 841 F.2d 6, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1988). The First Circuit, summarizing the authorities, explained that "claim preclusion applies if the new defendant is 'closely related to a defendant from the original action—who was not named in the previous law suit,' not merely when the two defendants are in privity." Airframe Sys., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 601 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting Negron-Fuentes v. UPS Supply Chain Sols., 532 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2008)). These authorities reject the "contention that nonparty defendants to an initial action can invoke claim preclusion as a defense in a later suit only if they can show that the nonparty defendant was in privity with the initial defendant." Id.
The rationale of Fowler and comparable decisions from other circuits supports the district court's application of claim preclusion here. Elbert unsuccessfully brought First and Fourth Amendment claims against Detective Gibbs in his first action based on the police raid of the Club on December 10, 2011. He now seeks to bring two new constitutional claims, under the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and a new state law claim alleging conversion, against Gibbs and twenty-one officers whom he asserts were co-perpetrators with Gibbs, all based on the same police raid on December 10, 2011.
There is no good reason why Elbert should have a second chance to add these claims and defendants. All of his claims arise out of the same police raid, and all of his new claims allege that Detective Gibbs, the defendant in the first action, and the twenty-one police officers added in the second, acted together to violate his rights. Elbert could have brought the new claims against Gibbs in the first action and failed to do so. He could have joined the twenty-one police officers as defendants in the first action but failed to do so in a timely manner. As the district court explained, allowing Elbert to circumvent the district court's ruling on his untimely motion for leave to amend in the first action by bringing a second action against the new defendants  would unreasonably burden the parties and the court: The "defendants, and [the district] court and staff expended an inordinate amount of judicial resources over a period of five years in the litigation of the prior action." R. Doc. 13, at 6. "Any other rule would enable plaintiff to avoid the doctrine of res judicata by the simple expedient of not naming all possible defendants in [his] first action." Ruple v. City of Vermillion, 714 F.2d 860, 862 (8th Cir. 1983) (applying South Dakota law).
To support its strict privity requirement, the majority relies on Headley v. Bacon, 828 F.2d 1272 (8th Cir. 1987) and Irving v. Dormire, 586 F.3d 645 (8th Cir. 2009). But Headley and Irving could not overrule Fowler and did not purport to do so. The claims and defendants in Headley and Irving did not have the sort of close relationship that warranted nonmutual claim preclusion in prior decisions from this court and other circuits. In both cases, the court focused on the rule that an earlier suit against a municipality or a defendant in his official capacity does not bar a subsequent suit against defendants in their individual capacities. Headley, 828 F.2d at 1279; Irving, 586 F.3d at 647. The court in Headley also explained that the interests of the new defendants "were divergent and in one case even adverse" to the defendants in the first action. Id. at 1277. This case does not present those situations.
To be sure, Taylor v. Sturgell rejected claim preclusion against a nonparty plaintiff based on a notion that the nonparty received "virtual representation" by a different plaintiff in a first action. But Taylor involved different considerations than this case. A plaintiff who was not a party to a first action "generally has not had a 'full and fair opportunity to litigate' the claims and issues settled in that suit." 553 U.S. at 892. Elbert, of course, was a party and had ample opportunity to litigate his claims against Gibbs and the twenty-one police officers in his first action; he simply failed to do so. The question here is not whether Elbert is entitled to the time-honored tradition of "his own day in court," id. at 893 (quoting Richards, 517 U.S. at 798), but whether he gets "a second bite at the apple." Lubrizol Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 871 F.2d 1279, 1288 (5th Cir. 1989) (citing Gambocz).
Courts and commentators have recognized the continuing vitality of nonmutual claim preclusion after Taylor. See Airframe Sys., 601 F.3d at 17 n.8; 18A Wright & Miller § 4464.1, at 699-710; Gonzalez v. Sepulveda, No. C 13-1272, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113843, 2014 WL 4062742, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2014); McCoy v. Blossom, No. 09-cv-2146, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37605, 2014 WL 1120346, at *4 (W.D. La. Mar. 20, 2014). There is substantial support for a federal common law rule of preclusion in these circumstances, and I would affirm the judgment.
