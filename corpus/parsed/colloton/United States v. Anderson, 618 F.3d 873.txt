I join the opinion of the court. I add these additional views in light of the concerns expressed by the separate opinion of my colleague that follows -- namely, that the state of the law effectively "shifts the burden of proof" under USSG § 2D1.1(b)(1) to the defendant in a manner that "should not be permitted under our system of justice," post, at 18, and that on the facts of this case, "the tail wags the dog, to the detriment of the defendant." Post, at 17.
The law of this circuit on § 2D1.1(b)(1) is clear that the burden to prove the adjustment rests with the government. In United States v. Peroceski, 520 F.3d 886 (8th Cir. 2008), we disagreed with the view of all other circuits to have considered the matter that the language of "clear improbability" in application note 3 to § 2D1.1 shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to disprove a connection between the weapon and the offense. Id. at 889. Instead, we held that "[t]he burden is always on the government to prove that a defendant is subject to a sentencing enhancement," and that under § 2D1.1(b)(1), the government must "show that it is not clearly improbable that the weapon was connected to the drug offense." Id.
Even those circuits holding that the "clear improbability" standard shifts the burden of proof to the defendant uniformly have rejected claims that the scheme violates the Due Process Clause. These courts reason that because the guideline itself requires only proof that the weapon was possessed during commission of the offense to justify the enhancement, see § 2D1.1(b)(1), "[t]he [c]ommentary . . . creates an exception to the terms of the [g]uideline, not a presumption that a connection existed" between the weapon and the offense. United States v. Restrepo, 884 F.2d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir. 1989) (emphasis added). On this view, there is no constitutional flaw in the guideline, because "[t]he Due Process Clause does not require that the government prove the absence of every possible exception or mitigating circumstance." Id. (citing McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 88, 106 S. Ct. 2411, 91 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1986); Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210-11, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977)); accord United States v. Rhodes, 322 F. App'x 336, 344 n.3 (4th Cir. 2009); United States v. Bjorkman, 270 F.3d 482, 493 (7th Cir. 2001); United States v. Roberts, 980 F.2d 645, 648 n.3 (10th Cir. 1992); United States v. McGhee, 882 F.2d 1095, 1097-99 (6th Cir. 1989). Most of these cases, moreover, rejected a constitutional challenge to § 2D1.1(b)(1) even when the guidelines were mandatory. Under the present advisory system, of course, a district court may incorporate its own policy views, including disagreement with the guidelines, in fashioning a sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). See Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 101-02, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007).
Most significant for present purposes, the record in this case does not support the suggestion that the guideline and commentary resulted in a tail-wags-dog scenario that victimized Aaron Anderson. The district court, perhaps due to a conflicting line of authority in this circuit that required the government to show a probable connection between weapon and offense, see Peroceski, 520 F.3d at 887, found by a "preponderance of the evidence" that "it was clearly probable that the gun was associated with [Anderson's] drug trafficking." S. Tr. 11, 13 (emphasis added). This finding was well supported by the evidence.
As the opinion of the court recounts, Anderson was a substantial crack cocaine dealer, operating from his residence in Davenport, Iowa. He placed a nine millimeter handgun, two loaded clips, and a box of ammunition -- recognized tools of the drug trade -- in a nearby storage unit for which he possessed the keys. He rented the storage unit (like his cell phone) in the name of his girlfriend, consistent with the practice of drug traffickers who hide assets in an effort to avoid detection. When questioned by police, after falsely denying responsibility for crack cocaine found in his kitchen, Anderson claimed that he was holding the gun in the Davenport storage unit for an incarcerated cousin from Chicago, at the request of the cousin's sister. Anderson displayed a modus operandi of placing assets in strategic locations in Davenport to facilitate his criminal activity. At one point, he parked two vehicles at different locations to enable flight in case of an unexpected encounter with law enforcement.
Faced with this circumstantial evidence, the district court drew the reasonable inference that Anderson possessed the handgun in connection with his drug trafficking activity, finding it "obvious" that "there was no legitimate explanation for a gun." The district court quite reasonably disbelieved Anderson's story that he was merely holding the gun, with loaded clips and a box of ammunition, for a jailed relative who formerly lived 175 miles away. Anderson claimed no other legitimate purpose for the gun; this was not an unloaded hunting rifle found in the closet. Cf. USSG § 2D1.1, comment. (n.3). The more likely scenario is that Anderson possessed the firearm and ammunition in an accessible location for use in his drug business as necessary, but kept it in a remote storage unit rented in his girlfriend's name so as to avoid responsibility for the gun if he was apprehended for drug trafficking. That the district court's decision foiled that strategy is no injustice.
KORNMANN, District Judge, concurring.
I concur in the result only because of the case law in our circuit and based upon a "clear error" standard of review. The fact that I would not have made the same finding that the district court made as to the weapon enhancement is of no moment. I concur certainly with the recognition in the majority opinion that this case as to the weapon enhancement is a "close case."
My concern is obviously with the weapons enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1). There was no evidence that the defendant or anyone else such as an associate, relative, or co-conspirator was ever seen with any firearm, much less in  the presence of illegal substances. There was no evidence that the firearm itself or any other weapon was ever in the same location as illegal substances. Here, the tail wags the dog, to the detriment of the defendant. The Sentencing Commission should immediately revise in a logical fashion Application Note 3 to the guideline in question. If necessary, the United States Supreme Court should examine the state of the law as to these issues.
We are told to apply the enhancement "if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense." What does it mean to "be present"? Apparently, it is sufficient if the weapon is present somewhere or perhaps anywhere. The majority opinion recognizes, however, the holding in United States v. Savage, 414 F.3d 964, 966 (8th Cir. 2005), that "[t]he mere presence of a firearm is an insufficient predicate for a § 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement." We know also that "[t]he dangerous weapon enhancement applies if the firearm is present during 'relevant conduct,' as defined by U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(2), not merely during the offense of conviction." United States v. Ault, 446 F.3d 821, 824 (8th Cir. 2006) (quotations omitted). I know of no allegation of relevant conduct in the present case.
In an unpublished opinion, the district court was affirmed based on its finding that there was a "likely connection" between the firearms and the drug activities. United States v. Thomas, 387 Fed. Appx. 671, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 15460, 2010 WL 2881429, at *1 (8th Cir. July 23, 2010) (unpublished) (per curiam). I submit that a finding of "likely connection" should be the required standard.
The majority opinion explains that, under the state of the law: (1) the government does not have to show a probable connection of the firearm with drug activity, (2) the government need not show that the defendant used or even touched a weapon to prove a connection between the weapon and the offense, (3) it is sufficient if the defendant "might" have hidden a weapon, (4) the required proof to support the enhancement creates a very low bar for the government to hurdle, and (5) the government has a "low burden of proof" as to the enhancement.
There is something fundamentally wrong with this state of the law. What ever happened to the common requirement that all the evidence against the defendant at a sentence hearing must meet at least a preponderance of the evidence standard? Should enhancements be levied based upon "might haves" or "could haves" or something similar? I submit not. The government is, under the state of the law, not only permitted to show that it is "not improbable" that the weapon was connected to the drug offense but is cut further slack to simply show that it is "not clearly improbable." A "not clearly improbable" standard, in effect, shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. This should not be permitted under our system of justice.
