, concurring in the judgment.
As a matter of first principles, I would agree with the court's ultimate conclusion in Part II. A movant seeking to vacate her sentence under Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 192 L. Ed. 2d 569 (2015), should bear the burden to establish that her sentence, more likely than not, was based on the residual clause of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). When the record of the sentencing hearing is silent or inconclusive, however, the post-conviction court must determine the issue according to the background legal environment in which the sentencing occurred. The process of determining the legal environment at the time of sentencing, and the legal significance of that environment, presents questions of law, not fact. And here, it was settled under Eighth Circuit law at the time of Golinveaux's sentencing that her conviction  for second degree robbery in Iowa qualified as a violent felony under the "force clause" of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). So the sentence, as a matter of law, was not based on the residual clause of § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).
But Walker v. United States, 900 F.3d 1012 (8th Cir. 2018), seems to preclude this approach, because it declared that "[w]hether the residual clause provided the basis for an ACCA enhancement is a factual question for the district court." Id. at 1015 (emphasis added). Consistent with treating the matter as a question of fact, Walker said that "the district court may consider the relevant background legal environment at the time of . . . sentencing," if the record or an evidentiary hearing is inconclusive about the basis for the sentence. Id. (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted). Walker cited a footnote in Beeman v. United States, 871 F.3d 1215 (11th Cir. 2017), to declare that "the basis for an enhancement is 'a historical fact.'" The Beeman footnote, in turn, discussed how the background legal environment cast light on what it described as a "question of historical fact." Id. at 1224 n.5.
Although the sentencing record in Walker was "sparse," 900 F.3d at 1015, and did not reveal whether the sentencing court relied on the residual clause, see United States v. Walker, No. 4:02-cr-00161, R. Doc. 161, 162, this court remanded the post-conviction case to the district court, saying that "it is the function of the District Court rather than the Court of Appeals to determine the facts." 900 F.3d at 1015 (quoting Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533, 543, 108 S. Ct. 2529, 101 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1988)). There would have been no need to remand for factual findings if the meaning and significance of the background legal environment were questions of law.
The appellant in Walker objected to treating the background legal environment as a factual issue, Walker, No. 16-4284, Pet. for Reh'g at 5-9, and the government acknowledged that Walker went "a step beyond" decisions of other circuits that would not have called for a remand, id., Resp. to Pet. at 11, but the court denied the appellant's petition for rehearing on that point, and we are thus bound by Walker as written. Other circuits allow the court of appeals to determine what was the background legal environment at the time of sentencing, ante, at 5, but Walker did not cite those decisions for the proposition that the substance and significance of the legal environment is an issue of law. So while the court's ultimate conclusion in Part II would be correct in a case of first impression—the background legal environment raises questions of law, not fact—the reasoning is problematic in light of Walker.3 
There is a different reason, however, to affirm the denial of Golinveaux's motion. The majority opinion ultimately agrees. Even assuming that Golinveaux could show that her original sentence was based on the residual clause, there is no need for resentencing if the district court would be required to impose the same sentence under current law. Any error in relying on the residual clause would be harmless. See  Fletcher v. United States, 858 F.3d 501, 506-08 (8th Cir. 2017).
Golinveaux is subject to enhanced punishment as an armed career criminal if she sustained three prior convictions for a violent felony or a controlled substance offense. She concedes that two prior convictions qualify as predicates. Golinveaux contends, however, that a third conviction—for second degree robbery under Iowa Code § 711.1 (1995)—does not count as a violent felony under current law. She asserts that the three subsections of the robbery statute are alternative means of satisfying a single element, see Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2249, 195 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2016), and that the first two subsections encompass conduct that falls short of "violent force" as defined in Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 139-40, 130 S. Ct. 1265, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2010).
The subsections of § 711.1, however, are best understood as setting forth alternative elements that define different crimes, rather than "various factual ways of committing some component of the offense." Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2249. State v. Wilson, 523 N.W.2d 440 (Iowa 1994), explained that the "essential elements" of robbery were "(1) intent to commit a theft, and (2) an assault in carrying out the intent to commit a theft," id. at 441, thereby showing that the assault subsection of § 711.1 is an alternative element in its own right. The trial information in Golinveaux's case is consistent with this understanding. By alleging that Golinveaux, "having the intent to commit a theft[,] committed an assault upon employees . . . in violation of § 711.1(1)," the charging document referenced only one alternative to the exclusion of the others. See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2257.
The judicial record shows that Golinveaux was convicted under § 711.1(1), the assault alternative under the Iowa robbery statute. Golinveaux does not dispute that the underlying assault statute, Iowa Code § 708.1 (1995), is divisible under current law, see United States v. Smith, 171 F.3d 617, 620-21 (8th Cir. 1999), and she does not claim any error by the district court in relying on unobjected-to statements in the presentence report to determine that she violated either § 708.1(1) or § 708.1(3). Cf. United States v. Garcia-Longoria, 819 F.3d 1063, 1067 (8th Cir. 2016). Nor does she dispute the district court's conclusion that a robbery committed by either type of assault is a violent felony under current law because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against another person. See Smith, 171 F.3d at 621; United States v. Boots, 816 F.3d 971, 974 (8th Cir. 2016) (per curiam).
Therefore, Golinveaux's prior conviction for second degree robbery in Iowa counts as a violent felony under current law. She has three qualifying predicate convictions under current law, and any error in using the residual clause to classify her as an armed career criminal at the original sentencing is harmless. I therefore concur in the judgment to affirm the district court.
