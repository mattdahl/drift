The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for the district court to establish a scheduling order, to modify a scheduling order for good cause, and to sanction a party that fails to comply with a scheduling order regarding disclosure of expert reports. In this case, the plaintiffs sought to submit a supplemental expert report after the deadline in the scheduling order. The district court did not find good cause to modify the schedule, and thus concluded that the plaintiffs should be sanctioned for their late submission. Rather than exclude the late report entirely, the court exercised its discretion to impose a lesser sanction: plaintiffs were permitted to file the untimely expert report, but they were required to pay the defendants costs in the amount of $61,222.14 that were incurred as a result of the tardy submission. I conclude that the court's order was consistent with the rules of procedure and a permissible exercise of discretion.
Rule 16(b)(1) requires the district court to issue a scheduling order. The order in this case required the parties to disclose expert reports by January 15, 2014. The plaintiffs sought to disclose the revised expert report in March 2014. The district  court correctly concluded that the report was not a proper supplement under Rule 26(e). The court found instead that the plaintiffs were "seeking to submit expert materials well after the deadline for disclosure of expert reports," and treated the revision as an ordinary expert report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B).
Another provision on scheduling, Rule 16(b)(4), provides that a schedule may be modified "only for good cause and with the judge's consent." The plaintiffs did not establish good cause to modify the schedule for disclosing expert reports, so the revised report was untimely. The court concludes that the analysis stops there, but lack of good cause under Rule 16(b) is not the end of the matter.
The time to disclose expert reports is governed by Rule 26(a)(2)(D), which in turn incorporates the deadline of the court's scheduling order. A party who makes an untimely disclosure of an expert report violates Rule 26(a). But another rule of civil procedure addresses what to do if a party fails to provide information as required by Rule 26(a).
Rule 37(c)(1), entitled "Failure to Disclose or Supplement," provides:
If a party fails to provide information . . . as required by Rule 26(a) . . . , the party is not allowed to use that information . . . to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard . . . may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure . . . .
As several courts have recognized, when a party lacks good cause to modify a scheduling order, and thus violates Rule 26(a) by making a late disclosure, the inquiry turns to Rule 37(c)(1). If the failure to comply with Rule 26(a) "was substantially justified or is harmless," then the untimely report may be used at trial despite the violation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). If neither of those criteria is satisfied, then the court must determine the appropriate sanction under Rule 37(c)(1). See Wong v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 410 F.3d 1052, 1060-62 (9th Cir. 2005); Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985, 993 (10th Cir. 1999); Vinson v. Mich.

The district court properly followed that sequence here. The court did not find good cause to modify the scheduling order, so it turned to Rule 37 and the consequences for failure to disclose in accordance with the schedule. The court found that plaintiffs' lapse was not substantially justified or harmless. So the court then considered the appropriate sanction under Rule 37(c)(1).
The first sentence of Rule 37(c)(1) says that a party failing to disclose "is not allowed to use that information" at trial. The advisory committee notes describe this as a "self-executing sanction for failure to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a),  without need for a motion" for sanctions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c) advisory committee's note to 1993 amendment. But while the sanction of excluding evidence is "automatic" in the sense that the court may apply it without a motion or hearing, see id., it is not the only sanction available. Design Strategy, Inc. v. Davis, 469 F.3d 284, 297-98 (2d Cir. 2006). The second sentence of Rule 37(c)(1) says plainly that "[i]n addition to or instead of this sanction," the court may consider other options "on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard." One option available "instead of" excluding the information is to "order payment of the reasonable expenses . . . caused by the failure" to comply with Rule 26(a). Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)(A). The district court selected this option after receiving a motion from the plaintiffs and giving both parties an opportunity to be heard on the question.
The district court did not abuse its discretion in selecting a lesser sanction than exclusion of the information contained in the untimely expert report. The court recognized that while plaintiffs caused delay and duplication of work by the defendants, the new information was "useful and necessary to the disposition of the case on the merits." The court permissibly expressed a preference for disposition of the case on the merits, and elected to impose a sanction expressly authorized by Rule 37(c)(1)(A) to compensate the defendants. This determination was consistent with the rules of procedure and a reasonable exercise of the district court's discretion in managing the litigation.
In reversing the judgment, the court characterizes the district court's order as one that "extended the Rule 16(b) disclosure deadline" to allow the revised expert report, ante, at 14, but the order did not do so. The deadline for disclosure of expert witnesses was January 15, 2014, and the district court did not extend or modify it. See R. Doc. 145, 149, 295. Instead, the district court recognized that the revised report was late, allowed the plaintiffs to file the report, and imposed sanctions for submitting a report after the deadline. There would have been no reason or authority to impose sanctions if the disclosure were timely under a revised scheduling order. Having ruled that the plaintiffs would be allowed, with sanctions, to file the untimely revised report and to use information from the report, the court then revised other scheduling deadlines by stipulation of the parties and for good cause. R. Doc. 277, 295.
The court also seems to believe that the district court did not address whether the plaintiffs could "use" the untimely expert report within the meaning of Rule 37(c)(1). Ante, at 14-15 & n.4. But the whole purpose of submitting the revised expert report was to use at trial the information described therein, so the district court rightly addressed whether the plaintiffs' untimeliness warranted "complete exclusion of the new information." R. Doc. 275, at 5. Accord Vinson, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41705, 2018 WL 1312400, at *2; Simmons, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115407, 2016 WL 4537744, at *3 n.5; Paulus, 315 F.R.D. at 15-18; Hawk-Beauchman, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184925, 2015 WL 12780572, at *1-3; Schardine, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88046, 2014 WL 2918420, at *2-3; Great N. Ins. Co., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78590, 2010 WL 3074340, at *2 & n.4. It would be passing strange to construe Rule 37(c)(1) as authorizing a district court to permit use of an undisclosed expert's information at trial but not to allow filing and disclosure of the same expert's report before trial.
For these reasons, I conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the plaintiffs to present evidence at trial based on their expert's revised report. Unlike a practice of allowing untimely pleading amendments under the liberal standard of Rule 15(a), see Sherman v. Winco Fireworks, Inc., 532 F.3d 709, 716 (8th Cir. 2008), the district court's ruling  gives effect to the "good cause" requirement of Rule 16(b) by exacting a sanction from the plaintiffs for failing to comply with the scheduling order. Where Rule 37(c)(1) specifically contemplates that a court may choose a sanction other than exclusion for a submission that is untimely under the scheduling order, we have no authority to superimpose the good-cause requirement of Rule 16(b) in that context. Therefore, the court properly allowed the expert to testify based on his revised report after sanctioning the plaintiffs.
The parties raise several other claims of error concerning the district court's rulings in the case, but the court does not address them after concluding that the district court was required to exclude the revised expert report. Given the court's disposition, discussion of the other issues in this separate writing would be largely an academic exercise. None of the other points raised would justify the relief ordered by the court, so I respectfully dissent.
