, concurring in the judgment.
Although I do not join the lead opinion and its incorporation of the analysis in Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe v. Noem, No. 18-1271, from which I dissent, I concur in the judgment here: The South Dakota excise tax on gross receipts of a non-Indian
contractor for services performed on the Tribe's casino is not preempted. The decisions in White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1980), and Ramah Navajo School Board, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue of New Mexico, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982), striking state taxes are not controlling in this context. There is no comprehensive and pervasive federal regulatory scheme of casino construction that precludes state taxation. See ante, at 6-7. That sort of federal regulation was essential to decisions in Bracker, 448 U.S. at 148, 151 n.15, and Ramah, 458 U.S. at 839, 844 n.8; without it, the Tribe's preemption argument has little force. This case also does not exhibit "complete abdication or noninvolvement of the State in the on-reservation activity," Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 185, 109 S. Ct. 1698, 104 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1989), for the State licenses architects and engineers working on the construction project, R. Doc. 33-11, at 9-15; R. Doc. 33-40, at 2-3; R. Doc. 69-21, at 7, 19; R. Doc. 72, at 14 (¶¶ 81-82); R. Doc. 80-13, at 11-12, issues permits for and conducts inspections of electrical work on the project, R. Doc. 33-36, at 2-3; R. Doc. 69-14, at 4-5, and may approve a paving-mix manufacturer for the project. R. Doc. 33-11, at 12; R. Doc. 72, at 16 (¶ 88); R. Doc. 72-11, at 3 (¶ 1.6(A)). There is no evidence that the excise tax "will impede the Tribe's ability to conduct its Class III gaming activities to generate gaming revenue," ante, at 8, and any effect on federal Indian gaming policy is too indirect and too insubstantial to justify a finding of preemption in any event. See Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S. at 187. I thus concur in the judgment reversing the grant of summary judgment for the Tribe on its first, second, and third claims, granting the motion to substitute, granting the motion to dismiss the State Treasurer, and remanding for further proceedings.
