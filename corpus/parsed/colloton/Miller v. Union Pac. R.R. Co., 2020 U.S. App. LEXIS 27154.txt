, dissenting.
Appellant Miller sued Union Pacific for negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). As the court acknowledges, "a railroad's violation of a safety statute . . . is negligence per se" under the FELA. CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 703 n.12, 131 S. Ct. 2630, 180 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2011). Negligence per se is a "label for what is simply a violation of an absolute duty." Carter v. Atlanta St. & A.B. R. Co., 338 U.S. 430, 434, 70 S. Ct. 226, 94 L. Ed. 236 (1949). As the court also recognizes, if a plaintiff shows that a railroad violated a statutory duty, then he has established negligence for purposes of the FELA and need not prove the common-law elements of foreseeability, duty, or breach. "Once the violation is established, only causal relation is at issue." Id.
Miller contends that Union Pacific violated a federal regulation promulgated under the Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA), 49 U.S.C. § 20103. The regulation governs main track switches, and provides as follows: "The normal position of a hand-operated main track switch shall be designated by the railroad in writing and the switch shall be lined and locked in that position when not in use," except in circumstances not applicable here. 49 C.F.R. § 218.105(b) (emphasis added). Each railroad must have an operating rule that complies with that requirement. Id. § 218.105(a). Union Pacific has such a rule, to wit: "The normal position of a main track switch is for main track movement, and it must be lined and locked in that position." R. Doc. 41-2, at 2 (emphasis added). When a railroad violates a requirement of the operating rule, the railroad "shall be considered to have violated the requirements of" the federal regulation. 49 C.F.R. § 218.105(a).
Whether Union Pacific violated the safety regulation depends on the meaning of the operating rule and the regulation. The rule requires that a main track switch "must be lined and locked" for main track movement. Miller was injured when a misaligned switch caused the train that he was operating partially to derail. Union Pacific operated the railroad track and the main track switch, so it was the "person" responsible for complying with the regulation and ensuring that the switch was lined and locked. See 49 C.F.R. § 218.105(a). At the time of Miller's injury, the switch was not "lined and locked" for main track movement. It follows that Union Pacific violated the safety regulation requiring that the switch must be lined and locked in the normal position. The railroad was therefore negligent per se under the FELA, subject to a possible defense based on an intervening and independent cause. See O'Donnell v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 338 U.S. 384, 394 n.7, 70 S. Ct. 200, 94 L. Ed. 187 (1949).
Union Pacific and the court advance several arguments to avoid this straightforward conclusion. First, the court accepts the railroad's contention that while the Safety Appliance Act and Locomotive Inspection Act impose absolute duties on railroads that are enforced through the FELA, Union Pacific has no "absolute duty" to comply with safety regulations promulgated under the FRSA. Ante, at 11. Given that violation of an "absolute duty" is synonymous with "negligence per se," Carter, 338 U.S. at 434, the court's reasoning effectively eliminates a claim of negligence per se under the FELA when it is based on a violation of railroad safety regulations.
The court's conclusion was effectively rejected more than sixty years ago in Kernan v. American Dredging Company, 355 U.S. 426, 78 S. Ct. 394, 2 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1958). There, the Supreme Court held that the FELA and the Jones Act both "impose upon the employer the duty of paying damages when injury to the worker is caused, in whole or in part, by the employer's fault." "This fault may consist of a breach of the duty of care . . . or of a breach of some statutory duty." Id. at 432-33 (emphasis added). The Court rejected the contention that "fault" was limited to violations of the Safety Appliance Act and the Boiler Inspection Act, or that an employee's injury flowing from a statutory violation must be the injury the statute sought to prevent. Id. at 433.
The employer in Kernan violated a rule promulgated by the Coast Guard, id. at 427 & n.1, and the Court deemed the infraction to be a violation of the statute under which the regulation was promulgated. Id. at 428, 438 n.8. The dissenting opinion in Kernan argued for a narrower view of the FELA, but acknowledged the Court's contrary conclusion based on earlier precedent: "The Court thus reads these decisions to establish a doctrine under the FELA that injuries following any violation of any statute, not simply the Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts, are actionable without any showing of negligence . . . ." Id. at 445 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).
Kernan guides the analysis here. Under the FELA, there is "a bright-line rule" that an "employer's violation of a statutory or regulatory duty gives rise to FELA liability for a resulting employee injury." Schmitz v. Canadian Pac. R. Co., 454 F.3d 678, 683 (7th Cir. 2006). As with the breach of the Jones Act regulation in Kernan, a violation of a regulation promulgated under the Federal Railroad Safety Act is the equivalent of a statutory violation that establishes negligence per se under the FELA. See id. at 682-83; Eckert v. Aliquippa & S. R. Co., 828 F.2d 183, 187 (3d Cir. 1987); Mosco v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R., 817 F.2d 1088, 1091 (4th Cir. 1987).
Second, Union Pacific and the court maintain that the railroad does not violate the safety regulation at 49 C.F.R. § 218.105(b) unless it undertakes an "act" that causes a switch to be out of alignment. Whether the railroad violated a regulation, however, depends simply on the meaning of the regulation. The regulation at issue says flatly that a track switch operated by the railroad "shall be lined and locked" in the normal position. The rule does not merely provide that railroad employees must refrain from acts that cause a switch to be misaligned. Where the text of the regulation does not define a violation in terms of a causative act of the railroad, the employee need not prove such an act to establish a violation. The court's inquiry into whether the railroad "played any part, even the slightest," in causing the switch to be moved, ante, at 9, confuses the question whether the railroad violated the regulation (and was therefore negligent per se) with the separate element of whether the employer's negligence (i.e., the violation of the regulation) caused the employee's injury. See Rogers v. Mo. Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1957) ("Under [the FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.") (emphasis added).
O'Donnell is illustrative. The Safety Appliance Act made it unlawful for a railroad to use any car that was "not equipped with couplers" that would remain coupled until set free by some purposeful act of control. 338 U.S. at 387 & n.2, 389. When an employee presented evidence "showing the breaking of the coupler," he established a violation of the Act, id. at 393, because the statutory requirement was simply to refrain from using any car that was "not equipped" with couplers that would remain coupled. The employee was not required to show that an act by the railroad caused the coupler to break. A railroad, the Court explained, could not "escape liability for a coupler's inadequacy by showing that too much was demanded of it, nor by showing that while the coupler broke it had been properly manufactured, diligently inspected and showed no visible defects." Id. at 393.
To justify reading a causal act requirement into the regulation on track switches, the railroad and the court invoke Edwards v. CSX Transp. Inc., 821 F.3d 758 (6th Cir. 2016), but the analogy is wanting. Edwards held that because a regulatory requirement that restrooms "shall be sanitary" was tied to a daily inspection routine, and the next required inspection had not "become due" when a particular restroom was found unsanitary, the complaining employee did not establish a violation of the rule. Id. at 761. The court attempts to draw a parallel by citing a regulation from Track Safety Standards that requires a monthly inspection of each track switch. 49 C.F.R. § 213.235. The required inspections, however, are designed only to "detect deviations from the standards prescribed in this part," that is, Part 213 of the regulations. 49 C.F.R. § 213.231 (emphasis added). The rule that a main track switch must be "lined and locked" appears in Part 218 on Railroad Operating Practices. The inspections under Part 213 are not aimed at detecting deviations from a standard prescribed in Part 218. The Part 213 inspection regime thus does not qualify the requirement of § 218.105(b) that a main track switch "shall be lined and locked" or absolve the railroad of responsibility for alignment of switches during the period between monthly inspections.7 
Third, Union Pacific defends the district court's conclusion that the safety rule on track switches includes a knowledge element, such that the railroad violates the regulation only if it knows or has notice that a switch is misaligned. The court does not adopt this argument, ante, at 12 n.4, and the railroad's interpretation is incorrect. The rule on alignment of main track switches appears in Part 218 of the regulations on Railroad Operating Practices. The railroad derives the knowledge requirement from a provision that appears in Part 213 on Track Safety Standards, which states: "any owner of track to which this part applies who knows or has notice that the track does not comply with the requirements of this part," must take certain actions. 49 C.F.R. § 213.5(a) (emphases added). The directive does not apply to Part 218 and the regulation on main track switches.
When the Federal Railroad Administration adopted the Track Safety Standards in 1998, the agency recognized that the "knowledge standard is unique to the track regulations; other FRA regulations are based on strict liability." Track Safety Standards, 63 Fed. Reg. 33,992-01, 33,995 (June 22, 1998). Ten years later, when the agency promulgated Part 218 and the rule on main track switches, it did not incorporate the "unique" knowledge requirement from Part 213. Therefore, a railroad violates the terms of § 218.105(b) if a switch is not "lined and locked" in the normal position, regardless of the railroad's knowledge.
Fourth, the railroad defends the district court's conclusion that the railroad's violation of the regulation was excused. The district court cited the common-law principle that "[a]n actor's violation of a statute is excused and not negligent if . . . the actor exercises reasonable care in attempting to comply with the statute." Restatement (Third) of Torts: Phys. & Emot. Harm § 15 (Am. Law Inst. 2010). The court does not endorse this conclusion either, ante, at 12 n.4, and the argument fails because the FELA does not incorporate such a common-law rule. The duty under the FELA to comply with a statute "is an absolute one, and the carrier is not excused by any showing of care, however assiduous." Brady v. Terminal R. Ass'n of St. Louis, 303 U.S. 10, 15, 58 S. Ct. 426, 82 L. Ed. 614 (1938). Liability "cannot be escaped by proof of care or diligence." O'Donnell, 338 U.S. at 390.
Based on the undisputed fact that the main track switch was not locked and lined in the normal position at the time of the accident, Miller has established that the railroad violated the safety regulation at 49 C.F.R. § 218.105(b). With one possible caveat, that is sufficient to establish negligence per se. In O'Donnell, the Supreme Court declined to say that a railroad may never effectively defend under the FELA by showing that noncompliance with a statutory command was the result of an "intervening and independent cause" such as "the work of a saboteur." 338 U.S. at 394 n.7. The parties and the district court have not addressed that issue in this case. On remand, the district court could determine in the first instance whether an "intervening and independent cause" defense is available under the FELA and, if so, could allow the railroad to present evidence of its saboteur theory as a defense at trial.
For these reasons, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
