, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.
For the reasons discussed in Simpson v. Norris, 499 F.3d 874 (8th Cir. 2007) (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), I would grant rehearing to reconsider the panel's conclusion that Andrew Sasser did not procedurally default his Eighth Amendment claim based on Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002), by failing to raise the defense of mental retardation in accordance with the Arkansas Code during state court proceedings. See Sasser v. Norris, 553 F.3d 1121, 1125 (8th Cir. 2009). Arkansas already complied with the Eighth Amendment rule of Atkins before Atkins was decided, see 536 U.S. at 314 & n.12; Ark. Code Ann. ยง 5-4-618, yet Sasser made no effort to invoke the protections that Arkansas law provided. The district court thus concluded that Sasser had procedurally defaulted his Atkins claim. Sasser v. Norris, No. 00-4036, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1769, 2007 WL 63765, at *6-7 & n.3 (W.D. Ark. Jan. 9, 2007).
The Sasser panel concluded that the district court's reasoning was "invalid" in light of Simpson v. Norris, 490 F.3d 1029 (8th Cir. 2007). Sasser, 553 F.3d at 1125. That is one plausible reading of Simpson, although the potentially applicable discussion is cryptic. See 490 F.3d at 1035. Simpson himself, on the other hand, argued in opposition to the State's petition for writ of certiorari that the issue of procedural default was not decided by this court, and that Simpson addressed only the applicability of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(e)(2) and the statutory requirements for an evidentiary hearing. Brief in Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 4, Norris v. Simpson, No. 07-653 (U.S. Jan. 16, 2008). Indeed, in response to the State's contention that this court's decision on procedural default conflicted with Dugger v. Adams, 489 U.S. 401, 407-10, 109 S. Ct. 1211, 103 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1989), Simpson urged that "the Eighth Circuit is still free to adopt [the State's] position if it is timely presented to that court in a later case." Brief in Opposition at 6.
In this case, the issue is squarely presented. The district court ruled that Sasser's Atkins claim was procedurally defaulted, and the three-judge panel of this court addressed the point directly. I would therefore grant rehearing to reconsider the panel's conclusion on procedural default.1
