, concurring in the judgment.
The crux of the insurance company's position on this appeal is that Eric Hayes cannot bring a tort claim for bad faith denial of an insurance claim unless there was an underlying insurance contract. The company (Met) argues that because it rescinded the insurance contract with Hayes from the beginning, and Hayes did not timely bring a breach of contract claim, there was no contract as a matter of law, so the tort claim must fail as well.
The straightforward answer to this contention is that Hayes did bring a timely breach-of-contract claim. The district court ruled that the claim was untimely because the limitations period is twelve months, and Hayes did not bring his claim until more than a year after the loss from fire on January 24, 2013. The better reading of Nebraska law, however, is that the limitations period is five years.
The ordinary statute of limitations for contract actions in Nebraska is five years, Neb. Rev. Stat. ยง 25-205, and no "insurance company shall issue . . . any policy . . . containing . . . any provision limiting the time within which an action may be brought to less than the regular period of time prescribed by [Nebraska's] statutes of limitations, unless otherwise prescribed by this chapter." Neb. Rev. Stat. ยง 44-357. A provision in Hayes's policy prescribes a one-year limitations period. Met argues that this shorter period is "otherwise prescribed" by Neb. Rev. Stat. ยง 44-501, which requires fire insurance policies to "conform as nearly as practicable to . . . context, provisions, agreements, and conditions with the 1943 Standard Fire Insurance Policy of the State of New York,"  because the New York policy contains a one-year limitations period.
The Nebraska Supreme Court, however, has held that where a fire insurance policy contains both a one-year statute-of-limitations provision and "provisions amending any terms of the policy which are in conflict with state statutes to confirm with such statutes," the limitations period prescribed by the policy must yield to the five-year period prescribed by Nebraska law for contract actions. Hiram Scott College v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 187 Neb. 290, 188 N.W.2d 688, 690 (Neb. 1971); see also Wulf v. Farm Bureau Ins. Co. of Neb., 190 Neb. 34, 205 N.W.2d 640, 641-42 (Neb. 1973). Hayes's policy included a provision stating that "[t]he terms of this Policy which are in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured premises is located are hereby amended to conform to such statutes." Under the reasoning of Hiram Scott College, therefore, the policy's one-year limitations period is invalid. The applicable limitations period under Nebraska law was five years, and Hayes's breach-of-contract claim was timely.
With a timely contract claim before it, the district court could properly address whether Met validly rescinded the policy. I agree with the court that we should uphold the district court's conclusion that Met either wrongly rescinded the contract or was estopped from doing so, and that Hayes was therefore a policyholder who could bring a bad faith claim. Like the court, I would affirm the district court's finding of liability on the bad faith claim and the award of damages and attorney's fees. Because Hayes does not seek additional relief on his breach-of-contract claim, a remand for further proceedings is unnecessary, and I concur in affirming the judgment of the district court. Under this analysis, it is unnecessary to address whether a putative policyholder may bring a bad faith claim when the insurance company purports to rescind the insurance contract ab initio and the policyholder fails to bring a timely claim for breach of contract.
