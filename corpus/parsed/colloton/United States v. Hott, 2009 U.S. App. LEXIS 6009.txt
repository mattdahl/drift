I agree that whether the appellant's conviction for "auto theft" in Minnesota qualifies as a crime of violence under USSG ยง 4B1.2 is controlled by United States v. Aleman, 548 F.3d 1158, 1168 (8th Cir. 2008), which in turn followed the panel decision in United States v. Williams, 537 F.3d 969 (8th Cir. 2008). Williams relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Begay v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 1581, 170 L. Ed. 2d 490 (2008), to overrule circuit precedent holding that the Missouri offenses of auto theft and tampering with an automobile by operation were crimes of violence. Williams, 537 F.3d at 971. Aleman applied Williams to auto theft in Minnesota. 548 F.3d at 1168. Williams and Aleman thus dictate that the appellant's conviction for auto theft is not a crime of violence.
A petition for rehearing en banc in Williams was denied on a vote of five to five, with one judge not participating. See United States v. Williams, 537 F.3d 969, 974 (8th Cir. 2008). The government, seeking a vote of the full court, then petitioned for rehearing en banc in a case that involved only the lesser-included Missouri offense of tampering by operation, and the petition was denied. United States v. Thomas, 300 F. App'x 447 (8th Cir.) (per curiam), reh'g en banc denied, id. at 447 & n.* (8th Cir. 2008); cf. United States v. Dabney, 300 F. App'x 432, 432-33 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (following Williams to conclude that auto theft without consent in Missouri is not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act).
Based on this sequence, it might appear that the full court has not been polled on the question whether the Williams decision should stand with respect to the offense of auto theft. This is true with respect to auto theft in Missouri, but auto theft in Minnesota is defined differently than auto theft in Missouri. The distinction between auto theft and tampering by operation in Missouri turns on the permanence of the offender's intent to deprive the owner of possession. See United States v. Johnson, 417 F.3d 990, 997 (8th Cir. 2005), overruled on other grounds by Williams, 537 F.3d 969. In Minnesota, however, an offender commits auto theft by taking or driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner, knowing or having reason to know that the owner did not give consent -- without regard to whether the offender's intent is to deprive the owner of possession permanently or temporarily. Minn. Stat. ยง 609.52, subd. 2(17). The elements of auto theft in Minnesota thus encompass conduct that would constitute both auto theft and tampering by operation in Missouri. And if tampering by operation in Missouri does not qualify as a crime of violence, then auto theft in Minnesota will not qualify, because the elements of auto theft in Minnesota do not require an intent to deprive the owner of possession permanently.
The full court has not been polled on whether to revisit the holding of Williams that auto theft in Missouri is not a crime of violence. 1  Even if the court were to overrule that aspect of Williams, however, such a decision is unlikely to affect whether a conviction for auto theft as defined in Minnesota qualifies as a crime of violence. With these observations, I concur in the judgment.
