Federal crimes are created by statute, and whether to include a mens rea element is a policy decision for Congress. A fair reading of the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1998 shows that Congress established certain misdemeanor criminal violations in 16 U.S.C. § 668dd(f)(2) that do not require proof of mens rea. In our system of separated powers, I would respect that choice and affirm the judgment.
The statute in question defines certain "[p]rohibited and permitted activities." Id. § 668dd(c). Appellant Mast's charged activities were prohibited: "No person shall disturb . . . any real . . . property of the United States, including natural growth, in any area of the [National Wildlife Refuge] System." Id.
The statute creates two misdemeanor criminal offenses set forth in a subsection entitled "Penalties":
(1) Knowing violations
Any person who knowingly violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Act or any regulations issued thereunder shall be fined under Title 18 or imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both.

(2) Other violations
Any person who otherwise violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Act (including a regulation issued under this Act) shall be fined under Title 18 or imprisoned not more than 180 days, or both.
Id. § 668dd(f).
A straightforward reading of the two subsections shows that Congress established  proof of an offender's knowledge as an element of the more serious offense, but declined to require any mens rea for the lesser offense. The court construes subsection (f)(2) to encompass violations committed "with all 'other' mental states," ante, at 5, but the statute does not say that. Subsection (f)(2) applies to all "other violations," not all "other mental states." A person "knowingly violates" the Act by knowingly disturbing System property; a person "otherwise violates" the Act by disturbing System property without the knowledge required under subsection (f)(1). Unlike mere silence, the text and structure of this statute provide the necessary "indication of congressional intent, express or implied, . . . to dispense with mens rea as an element of [the] crime." Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 606, 114 S. Ct. 1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994).
To justify reading a mens rea element of "negligence" into subsection (f)(2), the court, ante, at 3, cites the "universal" and "persistent" principle that "wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal." Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. 723, 135 S. Ct. 2001, 2009, 192 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2015) (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250, 252, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952)). But that principle does not support construing subsection (f)(2) to require proof of negligence. Elonis itself rejected a mens rea of "negligence" in 18 U.S.C. § 875(c), because it was inconsistent with the "universal" principle that the court here invokes. 135 S. Ct. at 2011. The court necessarily concedes that Congress in subsection (f)(2) departed from the principle that "wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal," for it concludes that the subsection does not require a mens rea of knowledge or even recklessness. The effort to derive a negligence element from the "basic principle" that negligence is insufficient is thus an unconvincing mismatch.
To be sure, the "background rules of the common law" are sometimes stated in a way that suggests a broader presumption—for example, "[t]he existence of a mens rea is the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles of Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence." Staples, 511 U.S. at 605 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). But again, these expressions trace back to common-law rules that knowledge or intent are usually essential elements of a crime. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 436-37, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978) (citing Blackstone's statement that to constitute any crime there must first be a "vicious will"); Morissette, 342 U.S. at 250-51 (same); Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 500, 71 S. Ct. 857, 95 L. Ed. 1137 (1951) (listing mental states of "knowingly," "maliciously," "wilfully," "with the purpose of," and "with intent to"). Where, as here, Congress plainly has eschewed the common-law rule by "creating an offense new to general law," see Morissette, 342 U.S. at 262, and dispensing with knowledge as an element of the crime defined in subsection (f)(2), the traditional background rules do not aid our interpretation. We are left instead with the ordinary meaning of a text that encompasses any person who "otherwise violates" the Act by disturbing System property.
The court also relies on the language of a Senate committee report to justify reading a "negligence" element into subsection (f)(2). The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works issued a report saying that the 1998 Act "lowers the penalty for unintentional violations (those not 'knowingly' committed)." S. Rep. No. 105-310, at 3 (1998), 1998 WL 596837. Aside from the ordinary problems with relying on legislative history—no bicameralism and presentment, focus on "intent" rather  than meaning, unfamiliarity of legislators with the material, and so forth, see generally Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 369-390 (2012)—the cited statement does not support the court's result. That the Act criminalized violations that are "unintentional" and not "knowingly" committed means that Congress overrode the background common-law rule that those elements typically are required. It may be that "intentional" means conduct that is "not merely negligent," McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U.S. 128, 133, 108 S. Ct. 1677, 100 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1988), see ante, at 6, but the converse of that proposition does not logically follow. "Unintentional" does not mean "negligent." One who acts without mens rea, just as much as one who acts negligently, commits an "unintentional violation" or one that is "not 'knowingly' committed."
While the offense defined in subsection (f)(2) is malum prohibitum rather than malum in se, it is within the province of Congress, in furtherance of interests that it deems important, to impose criminal penalties for conduct that otherwise would be innocent. "The definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute." Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 424, 105 S. Ct. 2084, 85 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1985). We may hope and expect that Congress will dispense with a mens rea requirement only in limited circumstances, but so-called "strict-liability offenses are not unknown to the criminal law and do not invariably offend constitutional requirements." United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. at 437. They may further a legislative goal of deterrence "by inducing a change in activity level." Richard A. Posner, An Economic Theory of the Criminal Law, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 1193, 1224 (1985). The Supreme Court, for example, long ago held constitutional a statute making it a felony offense to cut timber on state lands without a permit, despite the absence of a mens rea element. Shevlin-Carpenter v. Minnesota, 218 U.S. 57, 67-69, 30 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 930 (1910). A misdemeanor offense of disturbing the National Wildlife Refuge System regardless of mens rea is thus within the scope of permissible legislative action.
Without adequate support for his position in statutory text, common-law background rules, or legislative history, Mast is left with a policy argument against criminal offenses that lack a mens rea requirement. There is a case to be made for mens rea reform. See Benjamin Levin, Mens Rea Reform and Its Discontents, 109 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 491, 509-517 (2019) (describing legislative proposals "designed to address concerns about overcriminalization and statutes without clear mental state requirements"); John G. Malcolm, Morally Innocent, Legally Guilty: The Case for Mens Rea Reform, 18 Fed. Soc'y Rev. 40, 42 (2017) (arguing that legislative reform is warranted because "many criminal laws lack an adequate—or any—mens rea requirement," and "innocent mistakes or accidents can become crimes"); Rachel E. Barkow & Mark Osler, Designed to Fail: The President's Deference to the Department of Justice in Advancing Criminal Justice Reform, 59 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 387, 422 (2017) (observing that "most criminal law scholars and professional bar associations have lamented for years that strict liability laws have no place in the criminal sphere"). Judicial distaste for eliminating the requirement of mens rea in a criminal statute, however, must give way to the authority of Congress to make that choice. The district court's jury instruction accurately reflected the meaning of 16 U.S.C. § 668dd(f)(2), so I would affirm the judgment.6
