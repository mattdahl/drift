, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I concur with paragraphs five and six of the panel's memorandum disposition, affirming the ALJ's decision to discount Nurse Harrison's testimony and agreeing the ALJ correctly defined Austin's previous position as a garage supervisor. I respectfully dissent as to the remainder because Dr. Sorweide's observed "signs of malingering," combined with Austin's obvious embellishments, constituted evidence of malingering such that we should apply a more deferential standard of review to the ALJ's treatment of Austin's testimony. Applying that standard, we should affirm the ALJ's denial of Austin's disability benefits.
Our review of the ALJ's decision is generally under the deferential "substantial evidence" standard, but where an ALJ rejects a claimant's testimony about the severity of his symptoms, she must provide "clear and convincing" reasons "[u]nless there is affirmative evidence showing that the claimant is malingering." Reddick v. Chater, 157 F.3d 715, 720, 722 (9th Cir. 1998) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Ninth Circuit precedent does not necessarily require an explicit finding of malingering, just "affirmative evidence" of it. Valentine v. Comm'r Soc. Sec. Admin., 574 F.3d 685, 693 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted); see also Vertigan v. Halter, 260 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir. 2001).
I diverge from the majority in this case because I believe the review of the ALJ's consideration of Austin's testimony should be for "substantial evidence" because of the affirmative evidence of malingering in the record. The only independent examining physician, Dr. Sorweide, directly stated that Austin "shows signs of malingering." The ALJ cited this observation in her opinion. The ALJ did give Dr. Sorweide's opinion "partial weight," but only tempered Dr. Sorweide's conclusion that Austin could work "without physical limitations" because Austin's "impairments would reasonably account for at least some limitations." That is not inconsistent with malingering; indeed, a person who is malingering typically has some real symptoms, which he or she exaggerates.
In addition to Dr. Sorweide's opinion, the ALJ's credibility analysis pointed to clear exaggerations in Austin's testimony that were belied by other evidence in the record. Austin testified that his pain was so severe he was on crutches most of the time between 2009 and 2013, but the ALJ cited to medical evidence from 2012 which indicated Austin had no issues walking. The record also contains evidence from 2009, 2011, and 2015 that Austin was capable of walking without assistance. This led the ALJ to conclude that Austin's testimony about the "intensity ... of these symptoms [was] not entirely credible" and "well in excess of what is demonstrated in the medical evidence of record." In other words, she found him not credible specifically because she believed he exaggerated his pain.
This is affirmative evidence of malingering. Our standard of review for the ALJ's treatment of Austin's testimony should thus be for "substantial evidence," rather than requiring "clear and convincing" reasons. Reddick, 157 F.3d at 720, 722. The ALJ's detailed comparison of Austin's testimony regarding his limitations to evidence in the record (describing his continuing self-employment and ability to relieve some of his pain with ibuprofen) provided the required "substantial evidence" to properly discount his testimony. See Molina v. Astrue, 674 F.3d 1104, 1113 (9th Cir. 2012) superseded in part on other grounds by 20 C.F.R. ยง 404.1502 ("[Capacity for work demonstrated by daily activities] may be grounds for discrediting the claimant's testimony to the extent that they contradict claims of a totally debilitating impairment.").
Once established that the ALJ validly discounted Austin's testimony, her omission of Dr. Francis's opinion and her decision to only partially credit Austin's son's testimony were harmless errors. See id. at 1115 ("[A]n ALJ's error is harmless where it is 'inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.'") (citation omitted). The ALJ accounted for similar limitations presented by Dr. Francis and Austin's son in a hypothetical she posited to the vocational expert, asking the expert to identify jobs for those with only "occasional" use of the right hand. The ALJ further considered testimony that one job ("greeter") was available for persons with only "occasional" use of both hands.
"We will affirm the ALJ's determination of [petitioner's residual functional capacity (RFC)] if the ALJ applied the proper legal standard and [the] decision is supported by substantial evidence." Bayliss v. Barnhart, 427 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2005). Here, the ALJ incorporated the vocational expert's responses to both hypotheticals in her determination of Austin's RFC and appropriately supported a finding of "not disabled." Any lack of attribution or weight given to specific testimony from either Dr. Francis or Austin's son was harmless to the overall result.
Because I would affirm the ALJ's denial of Austin's application for disability benefits, I respectfully dissent.
