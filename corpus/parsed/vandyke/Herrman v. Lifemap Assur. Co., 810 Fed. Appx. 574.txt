Smith v. CMTA-IAM Pension Trust, 746 F.2d 587 (9th Cir. 1984) imposes a requirement in ERISA cases that courts in our circuit must award attorney's fees to a prevailing ERISA beneficiary "unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust." Id. at 589. I think the panel majority correctly applies the Smith requirement in this case, and so would join its well-reasoned decision if I thought Smith was reconcilable with Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co., 560 U.S. 242, 130 S. Ct. 2149, 176 L. Ed. 2d 998 (2010). But I don't. And because Hardt post-dates Smith and I am not aware of any binding opinion from this court that has applied the Smith presumption since Hardt, I think the Smith requirement falls with our court's rule that we are not bound by circuit precedent that is "clearly inconsistent" with intervening higher precedent. Lair v. Bullock, 697 F.3d 1200, 1207 (9th Cir. 2012). Without the distorting influence of the Smith requirement, I would affirm  the district court's application of the Hummell factors in this case.1 
In Hardt, the Supreme Court observed that the text of Section 1132(g)(1) "unambiguously allows a court to award attorney fees 'in its discretion ... to either party.'" 560 U.S. at 254 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1132(g)(1)). The Court noted that "[t]he words 'prevailing party' do not appear" in ERISA's fee-shifting statute, id. at 252, and distinguished ERISA's fee-shifting authority from other statutes requiring an award of fees to the "prevailing party," explaining that "'prevailing party' precedents ... do not govern the availability of fees awards under § 1132(g)(1)." Id. at 251. The Court also emphasized that Section 1132(g)(1) "vest[s] judges with such broad discretion" when determining whether to award fees. Id. at 254.
Smith, in contrast, treats Section 1132(g)(1) like a civil rights fee-shifting statute where the prevailing party must get attorney's fees absent special circumstances. See Smith, 746 F.2d at 589 ("As in cases involving section 1988 awards, a district court considering a motion for attorney's fees under ERISA should apply its discretion consistent with the purposes of ERISA, those purposes being to protect employee rights and to secure effective access to federal courts.") (emphasis added).2 Smith's rule removes all discretion from judges in the Ninth Circuit whenever an ERISA beneficiary is a "prevailing party," requiring our courts to award fees absent special circumstances. This is just a "prevailing party" fee rule by another name—exactly what the Supreme Court in Hardt disavowed. Indeed, in describing the "prevailing party" fee standard, the Supreme Court has used precisely the same "special circumstances" language that Smith used to describe ERISA's fee-shifting requirements. See, e.g., Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S. Ct. 964, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1263 (1968) ("It follows that one who succeeds in obtaining an injunction under [Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.") (emphasis added).
Because Smith's rule, borrowed from the "prevailing party" fee-shifting context, is inconsistent with Hardt's clarification that Section 1132(g)(1) should not be treated like a prevailing party statute, I would affirm the district court. I therefore respectfully dissent.
