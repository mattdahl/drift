The central question presented in these consolidated cases, which seek recovery of agency fees garnished from the wages of non-union members, is whether a good faith affirmative defense exists to a First Amendment compelled speech claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. I do not see a valid basis for recognizing such a defense. A good faith affirmative defense was not firmly rooted in the common law in 1871 when § 1983 was enacted, and nothing else compels recognition of such a defense today. For that reason, I would reverse the orders dismissing these cases and remand them for further proceedings.
My colleagues see it differently. Judge Rendell recognizes such a defense from precedent and out of consideration of "principles of equality and fairness." Rendell Op. at III.B. In concurring in the judgment only, Judge Fisher does not rely on a good faith defense. Instead, from an examination of pre-1871 common law, he identifies another limitation on the § 1983 cause of action: it may not be used to collect voluntary payments. See Fisher Op. at III.A. I disagree with these perspectives and respectfully dissent.
The Supreme Court has articulated standards for supplementing the plain text of § 1983, which itself identifies no immunities or defenses. Such supplementation requires a tradition "so firmly rooted in the common law and . . . supported by such strong policy reasons that 'Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.'" Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 637, 100 S. Ct. 1398, 63 L. Ed. 2d 673 (1980) (quoting Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 555, 87 S. Ct. 1213, 18 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1967)). Even if such a deeply rooted common-law tradition exists, that will still not permit supplementation of § 1983 in a manner inconsistent with the statute's history or purpose. See Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. 158, 164, 112 S. Ct. 1827, 118 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1992) ("[I]rrespective of the common law support, we will not recognize an immunity available at common law if § 1983's history or purpose counsel against applying it in § 1983 actions.").
I. A good faith defense was not firmly rooted in the common law in 1871 when congress enacted § 1983.
The specific inquiry here focuses on whether a good faith defense was firmly rooted in the common law in 1871. But as an initial point of reference, the good faith affirmative defense is not firmly rooted in the common law today — either generally or for any specific cause of action.
In articulating 18 affirmative defenses that must be raised in a responsive pleading, Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not include good faith. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c). The rule's listing is not exhaustive, and leading treatises supplement those 18 listed defenses, but those treatises do not identify a common-law good faith affirmative defense. See, e.g., Arthur R. Miller et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1271 (3d ed., Apr. 2020 Update) (recognizing no common-law good faith affirmative defense); 2 Jeffrey A. Parness, Moore's Federal Practice § 8.08 (3d ed. 2020) (listing affirmative defenses, such as immunities, but not including good faith). If a good faith affirmative defense were deeply rooted in the common law, such as defenses like statute of limitations, laches, or accord and satisfaction, then one would expect to find it listed in Rule 8(c) - or at least to make a showing in a leading treatise.
Similarly, a review of other statutory causes of action reveals that Congress has not understood good faith to be so deeply rooted as to go unspoken. Rather, when Congress wants to include good faith as an affirmative defense, it does so expressly.1  And that begs the question: if the good faith defense were so well established that it could be assumed "that Congress [in enacting § 1983] would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine," then why did Congress find the need to expressly provide for the defense in many other statutes but not in § 1983? Pierson, 386 U.S. at 555.
In sum, the absence of a good faith affirmative defense from Rule 8(c) along with its presence as a defense in other federal statutes suggests that today the good faith affirmative defense is not firmly rooted in the common law.
That conclusion, of course, is not dispositive — it could be that a good faith affirmative defense was deeply entrenched in the common law in 1871 but has lost traction over time. But cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c) (continuing to identify the virtually obsolete affirmative defense of injury to fellow servant). To make such a showing would require proof similar to that adduced in Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 71 S. Ct. 783, 95 L. Ed. 1019 (1951), wherein the Supreme Court determined that legislative immunity applied to § 1983 claims. See id. at 377-78. In reaching that conclusion, the Supreme Court relied on evidence of that immunity dating back to sixteenth and seventeenth century English law, provisions of the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution, as well as protections specifically articulated in 41 of the then 48 admitted States. See id. at 372-76.
By contrast no such evidence is present here. No party identifies a pre-1871 case recognizing a common-law good faith affirmative defense — either as a general matter or in the context of any particular cause of action. Judge Rendell's opinion does not identify any common-law basis for such a defense. Nor do any of the other courts applying a good faith defense to agency fee cases identify any grounding in common law for such an affirmative defense.2 
The strongest case for such a defense comes from Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissenting opinion in Wyatt v. Cole. There, he viewed the good faith defense as "something of a misnomer" because it actually referred to elements of the common-law torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of process. 504 U.S. 158, 176, 112 S. Ct. 1827, 118 L. Ed. 2d 504 & n.1. That perspective is telling. Chief Justice Rehnquist identified no authority for the proposition that good faith functions as a transsubstantive affirmative defense — applicable across a broad class of claims, such as the defenses of accord and satisfaction, laches, and res judicata. See id. at 175-80. Nor did his dissenting opinion recognize good faith as a claim-specific affirmative defense, such as the defenses of assumption of risk, contributory negligence, or duress. See id. At most, Chief Justice Rehnquist determined that the elements of two common-law tort claims could be defeated by proof of subjective good faith. See id. at 176 & n.1.
Judge Fisher picks up on that theme. From an examination of the common law, he concludes that in 1871 no cause of action allowed for later recovery of voluntary payments. See Fisher Op. at III.A. But unlike the cases he relies upon, the agency fee payments at issue here were not voluntary — they were wage garnishments that were paid to unions.3  More fundamentally, Judge Fisher's approach is analogous to the one that the Supreme Court did not adopt in Wyatt - which prompted Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissent. Section 1983 created a new statutory cause of action, not one pre-defined by the common law. Thus, it is immaterial that no pre-1871 cause of action permitted recovery for voluntary payments that were subsequently declared unconstitutional: the Civil Rights Act of 1871 established a new cause of action in part to provide "a remedy where state law was inadequate." Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 173, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1961), overruled on other grounds by Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1977).
For these reasons, I do not see the common law as limiting the scope of a § 1983 claim for compelled speech — either through a good faith affirmative defense or through a separate limitation on the statutory cause of action.
II. Both the history and the purpose of § 1983 counsel against recognition of a good faith affirmative defense.
For completeness, even supposing that the common law did recognize good faith as an affirmative defense in 1871, more would be required. Before a deeply rooted affirmative defense can apply to a § 1983 action, it must also be "supported by such strong policy reasons that Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine." Owen, 445 U.S. at 637 (internal quotation marks omitted). Put differently, a common-law defense will not be read into § 1983 when it is inconsistent with the history or the purpose of § 1983. See Wyatt, 504 U.S. at 164. And neither the history nor the purpose of § 1983 supports the recognition of good faith as an affirmative defense for violations of every constitutional right.
A good faith defense is inconsistent with the history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. As the Supreme Court has explained, that statute is predicated on the understanding that "Congress has the power to enforce provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment against those who carry a badge of authority of a State and represent it in some capacity, whether they act in accordance with their authority or misuse it." Monroe, 365 U.S. at 171-72 (emphasis added). As this statement makes clear, the history behind the Civil Rights Act, which Congress enacted pursuant to the Enabling Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,4  demonstrates the need to remedy actions taken in accordance with state law. And thus a good faith affirmative defense — that a state actor was merely following state law — is an especially bad fit as an atextual addition to § 1983.
Nor can a good faith affirmative defense be reconciled with the purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. The Supreme Court has identified "three main aims" for § 1983. Monroe, 365 U.S. at 173. Those were (i) "to override certain kinds of state laws"; (ii) to provide "a remedy where state law was inadequate"; and (iii) "to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, was not available in practice." Id. at 173-74. Each of those purposes reflects a dissatisfaction with the redress provided by state law for constitutional violations. It would seem, then, that state law would be the last place to look for limitations on the redress § 1983 allows — the whole point of the statute was to overcome the limitations of state law. Thus, absent some foundation in federal law, incorporating a defense rooted only in state common law into § 1983 is inconsistent with the purpose of that statute.
The later enactment of § 1988 also supports this conclusion. There, Congress allowed for consideration of state common law, but only to supplement "deficienc[ies] in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law." 42 U.S.C. § 1988. That is quite different than looking to state common law to limit the remedies permitted by § 1983.
Thus, even if it were firmly entrenched in the common law, a good faith affirmative defense should not be grafted onto the text of § 1983 - either as a transsubstantive defense (such as accord and satisfaction or res judicata) or a cause-of-action specific defense (such as assumption of the risk or duress).
III. The role of good faith in § 1983 litigation does not rise to the level of an affirmative defense.
Although good faith does not operate as an affirmative defense, it still may have a role in § 1983 litigation. As this Circuit recognized, proof of good faith may negate an element of a § 1983 claim. See Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O'Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d 1250, 1277-78 (3d Cir. 1994). Specifically, the gross negligence mental state element required for a procedural due process claim can be rebutted by a showing of subjective good faith through adherence to then-existing law. See id. at 1278. That holding was context specific, and it recognized good faith as a means to disprove a mental state requirement. See id. at 1277-78. Consistent with Chief Justice Rehnquist's observation, the Jordan decision used the term 'good faith defense' as a misnomer — it was actually applying good faith to negate a specific element of a cause of action, as opposed to asserting it as an affirmative defense. See id.; see generally Affirmative Defense, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) ( "A defendant's assertion of facts and arguments that, if true, will defeat the plaintiff's or prosecution's claim, even if all the allegations in the complaint are true."). Thus, I do not read our precedent as recognizing good faith as an across-the-board affirmative defense, or even as cause-of-action specific affirmative defense. At most, a showing of good faith can negate a mental state element of a claim — such as gross negligence required for a procedural due process claim. See Jordan, 20 F.3d at 1277-78. But that is of no moment here because a claim for compelled speech does not have a mens rea requirement. See Janus v. Am. Fed'n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., Council 31, 138 S. Ct. 2448, 2464, 201 L. Ed. 2d 924 (2018) ("[T]he compelled subsidization of private speech seriously impinges on First Amendment rights[.]"); see also United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 408, 416, 121 S. Ct. 2334, 150 L. Ed. 2d 438 (2001); Wooley v Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 717, 97 S. Ct. 1428, 51 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1977); W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642, 63 S. Ct. 1178, 87 L. Ed. 1628 (1943).
Beyond Jordan, Judge Rendell relies on "principles of equality and fairness" to justify a good faith defense. Rendell Op. at III.B. But in full context, the Supreme Court made clear that "principles of equality and fairness" were insufficient to establish immunity:
Although principles of equality and fairness may suggest . . . that private citizens who rely unsuspectingly on state laws they did not create and may have no reason to believe are invalid should have some protection from liability, as do their government counterparts, such interests are not sufficiently similar to the traditional purposes of qualified immunity to justify such an expansion.
Wyatt, 504 U.S. at 168. Nothing about that quotation validates "principles of equality and fairness" as standards for evaluating potential affirmative defenses. As explained above, the appropriate inquiry looks instead to the common law.
But even still, principles of equality and fairness would not carry the day here. Neither equality nor fairness overwhelmingly favors the reliance interests of the unions in pre-existing law over the free speech rights of non-members who were compelled to support the unions. The Supreme Court in Janus already accounted for those reliance interests in overturning Abood. See Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2484-86; see also Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 97 S. Ct. 1782, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1977). Those considerations need not be double-counted under the guise of a good faith affirmative defense. And that is to say nothing of the text, history, and purpose § 1983, which make it particularly ill-suited to a construction that elevates reliance interests over the vindication of constitutional rights.
* * *
Good faith was not firmly rooted as an affirmative defense in the common law in 1871, and treating it as one is inconsistent with the history and the purpose of § 1983. Nor does our precedent or even principles of equality and fairness favor recognition of good faith as an affirmative defense to a compelled speech claim for wage garnishments. I respectfully dissent and vote to reverse the orders dismissing the complaints and to remand these cases.
