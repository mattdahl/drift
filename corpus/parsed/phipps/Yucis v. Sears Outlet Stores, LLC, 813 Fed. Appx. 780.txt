I vote to affirm the dismissal of the complaint because it does not state a claim for public-accommodation discrimination. Elisabeth Yucis alleges that in attempting to purchase a refrigerator at a Sears Outlet store, she was subjected to harassment in the form of unwelcomed, overly flirtatious verbal advances by one employee, Len Jaffe. But that alone does not suffice for a claim for public-accommodation discrimination under New Jersey law. See N.J. Stat. Ann. ยง 10:5-12(f)(1) (prohibiting public-accommodation discrimination). Rather, such a claim also requires plausible allegations that the offending conduct was "designed to discourage a potential patron's use of a public accommodation." Franek v. Tomahawk Lake Resort, 333 N.J. Super. 206, 754 A.2d 1237, 1242 (N.J. Super. Ct., App. Div. 2000); see also Turner v. Wong, 363 N.J. Super. 186, 832 A.2d 340, 356 (N.J. Super. Ct., App. Div. 2003) ("[T]he focal issue is whether defendant acted with an actual or apparent design to discourage present or future use of the public accommodation by plaintiff on account of her protected status."). Because the complaint lacks allegations of that kind, the District Court did not err in dismissing it.
Judge McKee views New Jersey public-accommodation law differently. His dissent relies on Lehmann v. Toys 'R' Us, Inc., 132 N.J. 587, 626 A.2d 445 (N.J. 1993), to conclude that Yucis states a claim for sexual harassment in public accommodations. But Lehmann was a case about sexual harassment in employment, and the dissenting opinion identifies no New Jersey precedent that recognizes a claim for sexual harassment in public accommodations. Because the role of a federal court in diversity is "to ascertain what the state law is, not what it ought to be," we should not so extend New Jersey's statutorily defined public-accommodation cause of action. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 497, 61 S. Ct. 1020, 85 L. Ed. 1477 (1941). But even if New Jersey were to permit such a claim, that would require a showing of severe or pervasive harassment. See Lehmann, 626 A.2d at 453 ("[I]t is the harassing conduct that must be severe or pervasive, not its effect on the plaintiff . . . ."). And here, the allegations of a single instance of inappropriate comments unaccompanied by touching, physical threats, or humiliation does not constitute severe or pervasive sexual harassment. See Godfrey v. Princeton Theological Seminary, 196 N.J. 178, 952 A.2d 1034, 1045 (N.J. 2008).
I also believe that the dissenting opinion overreads dictum from Lehmann to conclude that, as a general matter, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination does not require a showing of fault or intent. See Lehmann, 626 A.2d at 454. Outside the context of sexual harassment in employment, the New Jersey Supreme Court has subsequently made clear that a discriminatory motive is essential to a disparate treatment employment discrimination claim. See Gerety v. Atl. City Hilton Casino Resort, 184 N.J. 391, 877 A.2d 1233, 1237 (N.J. 2005) ("Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere facts of differences in treatment." (quoting Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., 77 N.J. 55, 389 A.2d 465, 478 (N.J. 1978))). And as explained above, New Jersey appellate courts recognize a similar discriminatory-motive requirement for public-accommodation discrimination claims. See Turner, 832 A.2d at 356; Franek, 754 A.2d at 1242. Thus here, without plausible allegations of discriminatory intent, Yucis fails to state a claim for public-accommodation discrimination.
