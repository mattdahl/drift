, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
Because the statutory language in 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) and 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c) is mandatory, leaving no discretion to the district court, I concur with the majority opinion that the district court must enter a forfeiture money judgment against Mr. Waked and that such judgment must reflect the total money laundered through Mr. Waked's conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez, 803 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2015) (discussing the mandatory nature of 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c)); United States v. Fleet, 498 F.3d 1225, 1229 (11th Cir. 2007) (interpreting "shall order" language in 21 U.S.C. § 853(p)). Furthermore, the text of § 982(a)(1) and our precedent leave no question that the amount subject to forfeiture in this case includes the amount laundered by Mr. Waked, even if he paid those funds back to the bank. See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) (requiring forfeiture of "any property . . . involved in such offense"); United States v. Seher, 562 F.3d 1344, 1368 (11th Cir. 2009); see also United States v. Bermudez, 413 F.3d 304, 306 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that § 982(a)(1), read in conjunction with § 982(b)(2), allows for forfeiture of assets "up to the amount laundered . . . even if he never retained those funds").
I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority's discussion in Parts III(C) and IV of the opinion. The government has not yet sought substitute asset forfeiture. Similarly, the district court has not yet made the factual findings for it to conclude whether or not the forfeiture amount is excessive under the Eighth Amendment. Because it is premature for this Court to reach either of those issues on this appeal, I respectfully dissent from those portions of the majority opinion.
 I. Substitute Asset Forfeiture Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(p)
The government has three, nonexclusive avenues for forfeiture relief against Mr. Waked. See generally United States v. Candelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d 19, 42 (1st Cir. 1999) (discussing three types of forfeiture relief against a criminal defendant). First, the government may seek an in personam forfeiture money judgment against the defendant. United States v. Elbeblawy, 899 F.3d 925, 940-41 (11th Cir. 2018) (upholding district court's authority to enter forfeiture money judgments). Second, the government may seek direct forfeiture of specific property made forfeitable by statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), (b)(1); 21 U.S.C. § 853(a). Third, in the absence of directly forfeitable property, the government may seek forfeiture of other property belonging to the defendant—that is, substitute property—by meeting the requirements of 21 U.S.C. § 853(p). See 18 U.S.C. § 982(b)(1).
These three separate forms of forfeiture relief are reflected in the Rules of Criminal Procedure. A preliminary order of forfeiture must include the amount of any money judgment, direct the forfeiture of specific property, and, "if the government has met the statutory criteria," direct forfeiture of any substitute property. Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). If the government subsequently identifies substitute property subject to forfeiture under applicable statutes, it may move for a new or amended order of forfeiture. Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(e). Put simply, substitute asset forfeiture and forfeiture money judgments are separate forfeiture remedies. The latter is not dependent on the existence of forfeitable substitute property or the government's entitlement under § 853(p). See United States v. Lo, 839 F.3d 777, 792 (9th Cir. 2016) ("[W]here the government does not seek substitute property under Rule 32.2(e), but seeks only 'a money judgment as a form of criminal forfeiture under Rule 32.2(b),' those requirements [of § 853(p)] are inapplicable.").
Here, the government sought a forfeiture money judgment against Mr. Waked. It did not request relief under § 853(p)—the substitute asset forfeiture provision—in its initial and subsequent motions and memoranda nor did it identify specific substitute property to be forfeited. Specifically, the government stated that "[b]ecause the United States has not, as of this date, identified specific property to forfeit, it seeks a money judgment in" the total amount laundered by Mr. Waked. The government mentioned the statutes governing substitute asset forfeiture only in later briefing, and did so only to support its argument that the district court could (and must) enter a forfeiture money judgment even though Mr. Waked returned all laundered funds to the bank. Specifically, the government argued that "[t]he exemption in Section 982(b)(2) on forfeiting substitute assets would make no sense if Section 982(a)(1) limited forfeiture only to the amount of funds that a defendant had retained for himself." Moreover, in those filings, the government reiterated that it was seeking entry of an in personam forfeiture money judgment against Mr. Waked. Similarly, at the hearing on the government's forfeiture motion, the government pointed to the substitute asset forfeiture provisions to address the district court's main concern that it may be improper to order forfeiture of property that is no longer with the defendant. Thus, throughout the proceedings before the district court, the government maintained that it sought a forfeiture money judgment "in an amount equal to the amount of money that was involved in the money laundering offense."
On appeal, the government does not take the position that it is entitled to a forfeiture money judgment against Mr. Waked under §853(p) and § 982(b)(2) as a form of substitute asset forfeiture. Rather, the government acknowledges that the money judgment is a means for the government to memorialize Mr. Waked's forfeiture obligations so that it can later target substitute assets to satisfy that judgment. As it did below, the government discusses § 853(p) and § 982(b)(2) only to demonstrate that Congress, by incorporating substitute asset relief and providing a safe harbor for low-level laundering intermediaries, expressed an intent to hold large-scale money launderers liable for the total amount laundered, even if they do not retain the laundered proceeds. The government further clarifies its position by noting that a money judgment is necessary because it would "allow[] the government to enforce that judgment by attempting to locate substitute property belonging to Waked up to the value of that money judgment."
The majority opinion, however, suggests that substitute asset forfeiture is available to the government and rejects Mr. Waked's argument that the bank is not a third-party transferee for purposes of § 853(p)(1)(B). The majority's conclusion appears to stem from the notion that the government based its entitlement to forfeiture, at least in part, on the substitute asset forfeiture provisions. As discussed above, the record is clear that the government moved for only a money judgment. More importantly, such a conclusion would blend two separate forfeiture remedies, and relieve the government from complying with the requirements of § 853(p) while depriving Mr. Waked of the opportunity to contest them.
I agree that the government is entitled to a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of the money laundered by Mr. Waked, see 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), and that nothing in § 853(p) affects the district court's obligation to enter the requested money judgment. But any additional questions relating to entitlement to substitute asset forfeiture are not before this Court. Once the district court enters the requested money judgment, the government may seek forfeiture against substitute property owned by Mr. Waked, if any. If it chooses to proceed against such substitute property, the government would have to move under Rule 32.2 and meet the relevant statutory requirements by a preponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Hasson, 333 F.3d 1264, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 2003). This has not happened yet, and I therefore would not address any issues relating to that process in this appeal.
 II. The Eighth Amendment Analysis
In a footnote, the district court stated that the forfeiture amount requested by the government was constitutionally excessive under the Eighth Amendment because Mr. Waked's criminal activity caused little harm. The district court noted that, "if it were required to impose one, a forfeiture money judgment of $520,000 would be appropriate ($10,000 for each of the 52 transactions in this case)." In response, the majority applies this Court's excessive fine test in United States v. Sperrazza, 804 F.3d 1113 (11th Cir. 2015), and concludes that the district court erred in finding that any forfeiture money judgment beyond $520,000 would be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.1 
Sperrazza requires us to consider "(1) whether the defendant falls into the class of persons at whom the criminal statute was principally directed; (2) other penalties authorized by the legislature (or the Sentencing Commission); and (3) the harm caused by the defendant." Id. at 1127 (quoting United States v. Browne, 505 F.3d 1229, 1281 (11th Cir. 2007)). The second prong of that inquiry, which could afford a forfeiture order a strong presumption of constitutionality, see United States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1292 (11th Cir. 1999), requires a specific factual finding in this case.2  The maximum fine available against Mr. Waked depends on the total "amount of the criminally derived property involved in" Mr. Waked's offenses. 18 U.S.C. § 1957(b)(2); accord U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(c).
This Court recognizes that the district court is the best forum to decide and weigh the various fact-based considerations that drive the excessive fine analysis. See, e.g., Seher, 562 F.3d at 1371 (remanding Eighth Amendment issue to the district court for factual findings because this Court did not have a clear factual basis for evaluating whether forfeiture of certain assets would constitute an excessive fine); United States v. Land, Winston County, 163 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir. 1998) (remanding Eighth Amendment issue to the district court "[b]ecause the issue of excessive fines may depend on various factors and conduct with which the district court is more familiar than this court"). This allocation of fact-finding reflects this Court's limited role in reviewing forfeiture orders for constitutional excessiveness: "rather than strict proportionality, we review fines only for gross disproportionality." United States v. Chaplin's, Inc., 646 F.3d 846, 851 (11th Cir. 2011).
As the majority acknowledges, the district court has not made findings of fact as to the total amount laundered by Mr. Waked. And it follows that the district court has not made the factual findings required by Sperrazza based on that total amount. Thus, absent clear determinations from the district court, I believe that the proper procedure is to remand to the district court to provide it the opportunity to make the findings relevant to the excessive fine analysis and for this Court to defer its discussion until it is presented with those findings. Otherwise, by deciding a legal issue based on as-yet-not-made factual determinations, this Court risks issuing an advisory opinion "that merely opine[s] on 'what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.'" Gagliardi v. TJCV Land Trust, 889 F.3d 728, 733 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172, 133 S. Ct. 1017, 185 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2013)).
For the foregoing reasons, I concur in reversing the order denying a forfeiture money judgment to the government, but I would defer discussion on substitute asset forfeiture and the Eighth Amendment until those issues properly reach this Court.
