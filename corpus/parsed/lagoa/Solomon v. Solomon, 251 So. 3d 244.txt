I write separately to address section 61.13(3), Florida Statutes  (2018).i Our precedent in Tzynder v. Edelsburg, 184 So. 3d 583  (Fla. 3d DCA 2016), as well as opinions from other district courts, Witt-Bahls v. Bahls, 193 So. 3d 35 (Fla. 4th DCA 2016), and Perez v. Fay, 160 So. 3d 459 (Fla. 2d DCA 2015), require the trial court to set forth in its final judgment or order the specific steps necessary to reestablish unsupervised timesharing, and the trial court's failure to include such steps render the judgment or order legally deficient. Because we are bound by our prior precedent, I join the majority's opinion.
These cases, however, appear to establish a judicially created requirement not supported by the statutory language of section 61.13(3). "'[W]hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and construction; the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.'" Atwater v. Kortum, 95 So. 3d 85, 90 (Fla. 2012) (quoting Holly v. Auld, 450 So. 2d 217, 219 (Fla. 1984)); see also DMB Inv. Tr. v. Islamorada, Village of Islands, 225 So. 3d 312, 317 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017) ("'The Legislature must be understood to mean what it has plainly expressed and this excludes construction. The Legislative intent being plainly expressed, so that the act read by itself or in connection with other statutes pertaining to the same subject is clear, certain and unambiguous, the courts have only the simple and obvious duty to enforce the law according to its terms.'" (quoting Forsythe v. Longboat Key Beach Erosion Control Dist., 604 So. 2d 452, 454 (Fla. 1992))). "Florida courts are 'without power to construe an unambiguous statute in a way which would extend, modify, or limit, its express terms or its reasonable and obvious implications. To do so would be an abrogation of legislative power.'" Brown v. City of Vero Beach, 64 So. 3d 172, 174 (Fla. 4th DCA 2011) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Holly, 450 So. 2d at 219).
The language of section 61.13(3) is clear and unambiguous, and sets forth specific requirements for modifying parenting plans including time-sharing schedules. While it is certainly understandable that a parent would want to know the specific steps necessary to restore time-sharing with his or her child, "it is not the prerogative of the courts to rewrite a statute," Westphal v. City of St. Petersburg, 194 So. 3d 311, 321 (Fla. 2016), and section 61.13(3) does not mandate the inclusion of such steps in a trial court's judgment or order. Because section 61.13(3) contains no language mandating that a trial court set forth the specific steps a parent must take in order to reestablish time-sharing with a child, I therefore agree with the reasoning set forth in our sister court's decision in Dukes v. Griffin, 230 So. 3d 155 (Fla. 1st DCA 2017), and would certify conflict.
