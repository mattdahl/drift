I respectfully dissent. In his verified response to the corrected order to show cause, Mr. Jacobs identifies the corrective measures he is pursuing to address his actions before this Court.5  These measures are not insubstantial, and they indicate his understanding of the nature of his conduct. Because I find that Mr. Jacobs showed good cause in his verified response, I would discharge the order.
