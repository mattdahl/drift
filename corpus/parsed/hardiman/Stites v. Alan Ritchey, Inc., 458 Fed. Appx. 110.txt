, concurring in part and dissenting in part,
I agree with my colleagues that Appellants' retaliation claims fail at summary judgment. I disagree, however, that Appellants' discrimination claims fail for want  of pretext under Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 765 (3d Cir. 1994).
Before they were laid off, Appellants complained to management that Asian unloaders favored Asian inspectors in the distribution of work. Supervisor Arlene Yorgey validated these complaints, stating: "yes, I do know that . . . you're not getting the work because it's going down . . . to the . . . Asian girls." Under our precedents, an employer's reliance on objective criteria tainted by discrimination or inequality evidences pretext. See, e.g., Goosby v. Johnson & Johnson Med., Inc., 228 F.3d 313, 319-21 (3d Cir. 2000); Bray v. Marriott Hotels, 110 F.3d 986, 994-95 (3d Cir. 1997). In addition, ARI expressed racial bias 1  and hired employees immediately before and after the 2006 and 2007 RIFs. 2  Finally, the fact that some Caucasians survived ARI's layoffs and some Asians did not is not dispositive, see, e.g., Goosby, 228 F.3d at 321; Iadimarco v. Runyon, 190 F.3d 151, 165 (3d Cir. 1999), particularly where, as here, ARI eliminated all but six or seven Caucasian processing employees in just two years.
For these reasons, I would give Appellants their day in court.
