, dissenting.
"In our adversarial system of adjudication, we follow the principle of party presentation." United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579, 206 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2020). This assumes that "parties represented by competent counsel know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the . . . argument entitling them to relief." Id. (quoting Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 386, 124 S. Ct. 786, 157 L. Ed. 2d 778 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). So "courts normally decide only questions presented by the parties." Id. (quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). Because the Majority neglects this principle to reach an issue Appellants failed to raise properly, I respectfully dissent.
Appellants filed a renewed motion for class certification that the District Court construed as a motion for reconsideration. The Court reasoned:
Plaintiffs must meet a higher standard than before—they must show that either there has been a change in the controlling case law[] (they have not); new evidence is available that was not available when the Court denied the motion (they have not); or the need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent manifest injustice (they have not).
Hargrove v. Sleepy's LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221933, 2019 WL 8881823, at *7 (D.N.J. 2019). Appellants failed to present the issue of whether the District Court erred in applying this standard. Nevertheless, my colleagues conclude the District Court erred in "treat[ing] the renewed motion for class certification as a motion for reconsideration." Maj. Op. 4-5. They do so apparently based on a footnote in the procedural history section of Appellants' brief. See Hargrove Br. 11 n.12. But we have held that is insufficient to raise an issue or argument. See, e.g., Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, 824 F.3d 33, 53 (3d Cir. 2016) (arguments and issues "relegated to a footnote" are forfeited) (citing United States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 222 (3d Cir. 2005) ("It is well settled that an appellant's failure to identify or argue an issue in his opening brief constitutes waiver of that issue on appeal."), and John Wyeth & Bro. v. CIGNA Int'l Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997) ("[A]rguments raised in passing (such as, in a footnote), but not squarely argued, are considered waived.")). Moreover, Rule 28(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Rule 28.1(a) of the Third Circuit Local Appellate Rules require appellants "to set forth the issues raised on appeal and to present an argument in support of those issues in their opening brief." Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir. 1993).
The Majority contends Appellants did more than raise this issue in a footnote because they "elaborated in detail in their Reply." Maj. Op. 17 n.5. That's not enough. Appellants must present and argue each issue "in their opening brief." Kost, 1 F.3d at 182 (emphasis added). We have never (until now, apparently) established an exception to this rule where the appellee addresses the issue and the appellant subsequently "elaborate[s]" in the reply brief, or where the parties are not "surprised" because the district court "expressly discussed and ruled on the . . . issue." Maj. Op. 17 n.5. And for good reason. Such an exception will destabilize our forfeiture jurisprudence and undermine our clear and easily administrable rule. It will also invite mischief by permitting appellants to raise issues and arguments summarily in an opening brief, thus forcing appellees to guess at the questions presented and appellant's specific arguments, before presenting their full argument in a reply brief. This impairs our deliberative process.
The Majority cites several cases it believes support its decision to reach this issue. Id. None of them do. It cites Lark v. Secretary Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, 645 F.3d 596, 607 (3d Cir. 2011), and Bagot v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir. 2005), which discuss notice in the district court and our discretion to address issues waived below but raised properly on appeal. Neither case supports the Majority's decision because here we deal only with an issue not raised properly on appeal. Next, my colleagues cite In re: Asbestos Products Liability Litigation (No. VI), 873 F.3d 232, 237 (3d Cir. 2017), for their position that we should excuse forfeiture when, despite an appellant's failure to raise an issue properly in accordance with our well-settled precedent and the Federal and Local Rules of Appellate Procedure, the parties nevertheless have fair notice of the claim. In Asbestos, as in this appeal, appellants tried to preserve an issue in a footnote while committing their entire opening brief to other issues. We held that an "attempt to shoehorn in an argument" in a footnote is "insufficient to raise an issue on appeal," and that "[a]s a general matter, an appellant waives an argument in support of reversal if it is not raised in the opening brief." Id. We should apply the same rule here.
Consistent with our longstanding precedent, I would affirm the District Court and hold that Appellants failed to present and argue the issue of whether the Court erred in denying their renewed motion for class certification under the motion-for-reconsideration standard.1 
I also disagree with the Majority's conclusion on the merits. On the record before it, I cannot say the District Court abused its discretion in holding Appellants failed to establish ascertainability.
Appellants failed to show that the class was currently and readily ascertainable. See Marcus v. BMW of N. Am. LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 593 (3d Cir. 2012). They consistently presented a confused and incomplete method for ascertaining class members, which led the Court to its holding on ascertainability. The District Court did not reach this conclusion for lack of trying. It considered substantial briefing, heard argument, and allowed the parties to depose Appellants' key witness when their methodology remained unclear. Despite these opportunities, Appellants failed to establish ascertainability by a preponderance of the evidence.
As just one example of Appellants' shortcomings, consider the gate logs presented (and not presented) at the class certification stage. Appellants have consistently said Sleepy's gate logs are a key component of their ascertainability methodology. See, e.g., App. 1412 (Appellants' witness testified that the only way she could show a particular driver drove on a particular day was by cross-referencing an Outside Carrier Expense Detail report with the gate log). But even after discovery, Appellants failed to obtain gate logs for the full class period. And the logs they presented (from a few months in 2008 and 2009) were missing data. For that reason, the District Court questioned the reliability of those documents in Appellants' ascertainability analysis. And Appellants are to blame for this evidentiary defect because Sleepy's offered to provide all its gate logs but Appellants claimed it was "not [Appellants'] burden to review all of the gate logs . . . prior to class certification." Reply Brief in Support of Plaintiffs' Renewed Motion for Class Certification, Case No. 3:10-cv-01138, ECF No. 225, 11 n.15. So the District Court unsurprisingly concluded Appellants failed to meet their burden for ascertainability given their willful ignorance of the existence and substance of a central category of evidence.
Finally, in reversing the District Court's ascertainability determination, the Majority extends the holdings of Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L. Ed. 1515 (1946), and Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 136 S. Ct. 1036, 194 L. Ed. 2d 124 (2016). Maj. Op. 6 ("[W]here an employer has failed to keep records it was required to keep by law, employees can prove ascertainability by producing 'sufficient evidence' to define their proposed class as 'a matter of just and reasonable inference.'") (quoting Mt. Clemens, 328 U.S. at 687, and Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1046-47). I would not apply those precedents to this case because there was never any doubt that the plaintiffs in Mt. Clemens and Tyson Foods were employees. Here, the company in good faith believed the drivers were independent contractors. The District Court agreed with that classification, and only after the New Jersey Supreme Court held otherwise did they learn that the drivers were employees. See Hargrove v. Sleepy's LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221933, 2016 WL 8258865, at *1 (D.N.J. 2016); see also Hargrove v. Sleepy's LLC, Case Nos. 12-2540 & 12-2541, Petition for Certification of Question of Law ("We believe that this case raises an important issue of New Jersey law that is both determinative and novel.").
For the reasons stated, I would affirm the order of the District Court and respectfully dissent.
