I join Judge Smith's excellent opinion in full, but I write separately to express my doubt that the expression of the plenary power doctrine in Landon v. Plasencia completely resolves step one of the Suspension Clause analysis under Boumediene. Although Landon appears to preclude "alien[s] seeking initial admission to the United States" from invoking any constitutional protections "regarding [their] application[s]," the question of what constitutional rights such aliens are afforded was not squarely before the Supreme Court in that case because the petitioner was a returning permanent resident. 459 U.S. 21, 23, 32, 103 S. Ct. 321, 74 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982). Nor did the Court in Landon purport to resolve a jurisdictional question raising the possibility of an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.1 
Despite my uncertainty about Landon's dispositive application here, I am convinced that we would reach the same result under step two of Boumediene's framework. Unlike the petitioners in Boumediene—who sought their release in the face of indefinite detention—Petitioners here seek to alter their status in the United States in the hope of avoiding release to their homelands. That prayer for  relief, in my view, dooms the merits of their Suspension Clause argument that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e) provides an "inadequate or ineffective" habeas substitute. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 223, 72 S. Ct. 263, 96 L. Ed. 232 (1952).
