, dissenting.
The Majority concludes that Kevin Harris and Anthony Jackson are eligible for relief under § 404 of the First Step Act because they committed "covered offenses" under the statute. My disagreement with that premise requires this respectful dissent.

This appeal presents a difficult question of statutory interpretation: Does the penalties clause modify "Federal criminal statute" as Appellants Harris and Jackson argue, or does it modify "violation" as the Government suggests? As my colleagues rightly note, § 404(a) is susceptible to different interpretations. The weight of authority strongly favors the Majority since the Courts of Appeals for the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits have all adopted its position. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 954 F.3d 446, 448-49 (1st Cir. 2020); United States v. Johnson, 961 F.3d 181, 183 (2d Cir. 2020); United States v. Wirsing, 943 F.3d 175, 185-86 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Jackson, 945 F.3d 315, 321 (5th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 206 L. Ed. 2d 839, 2020 WL 1906710 (2020); United States v. Boulding, 960 F.3d 774, 781 (6th Cir. 2020); United States v. Shaw, 957 F.3d 734, 735 (7th Cir. 2020); United States v. McDonald, 944 F.3d 769, 772 (8th Cir. 2019).1  Yet several district courts have held that the Government has the better of  the argument. See, e.g., United States v. Blocker, 378 F. Supp. 3d 1125 (N.D. Fla. 2019); United States v. Willis, 417 F. Supp. 3d 569 (E.D. Pa. 2019). In my view, the district court opinions are more persuasive than those of our sister circuits.

The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 increased the drug weights of crack cocaine required to trigger certain mandatory statutory penalties. In particular, "[t]he Act increased the drug amounts triggering mandatory minimums for crack trafficking offenses from 5 grams to 28 grams in respect to the 5-year minimum and from 50 grams to 280 grams in respect to the 10- year minimum (while leaving powder at 500 grams and 5,000 grams respectively)." Dorsey v. United States, 567 U.S. 260, 269, 132 S. Ct. 2321, 183 L. Ed. 2d 250 (2012). But Congress did not make this change retroactive, so offenders responsible for 5 to 28 grams or 50 to 280 grams of crack before the Fair Sentencing Act faced harsher penalties than offenders who possessed the same amount of crack after its enactment.
Congress addressed this disparity by passing the First Step Act of 2018. As the Majority explains, § 404 of the First Step Act gives offenders who committed a "covered offense" the chance to seek a reduced sentence.
Central to the dispute in these appeals is whether district courts must consider an offender's statute of conviction or his actual conduct when determining whether he committed a "covered offense." The Majority concludes the statute of conviction controls. But the most natural reading of § 404 is that an offender's actual conduct dictates eligibility.

"A court's primary purpose in statutory interpretation is to discern legislative intent." Morgan v. Gay, 466 F.3d 276, 277 (3d Cir. 2006) (citation omitted); see United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733, 744 (3d Cir. 1994). We "presume that Congress expressed its legislative intent through the ordinary meaning of the words it chose to use." Knox, 32 F.3d at 744 (citations omitted). "Thus, it is axiomatic that when the statutory language is clear, the words must be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning." Id.; see United States v. Geiser, 527 F.3d 288, 294-95 (3d Cir. 2008) (using legal and general dictionaries to discern the ordinary meaning of words). The text of the First Step Act suggests an offender's actual drug quantity determines eligibility.
First, a "violation" is defined as "the act of violating," Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2005), or "[t]he act of breaking or dishonoring the law," Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (emphasis added). And "act" in this context refers to the conduct underlying an offender's arrest and conviction, not the words of the indictment or statute. Congress could have defined "covered offense" to refer to the statute of conviction. Instead, Congress defined "covered offense" as a "violation," which is an "act." See Sedima S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 489, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985) ("violation" does not imply a criminal conviction and "refers only to a failure to adhere to legal requirements"). By defining "covered offense" as a "violation," Congress intended courts to consider whether the Fair Sentencing Act changed the penalties for the offender's actual conduct—here, Harris and Jackson's possession with the intent to distribute more than 28 grams of crack.
 Second, the Majority says Congress's use of "violation" reveals little because the First Step Act applies only to those previously convicted. Maj. Op. 19. But Congress's use of "as if" and "committed" in § 404(b) also suggests courts must look to an offender's actual conduct to determine eligibility. To "commit" is "to carry into action deliberately," Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2005), or "[t]o perpetrate (a crime)," Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And "perpetrate" means "to bring about or carry out," Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2005), or "[t]o commit or carry out (an act, esp. a crime)." Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). Harris and Jackson "committed" their crimes when they possessed with the intent to distribute more than 28 grams of crack. So if a district court is to consider imposing a reduced sentence as if the Fair Sentencing Act was in effect at that time, it must consider the offender's conduct to determine which subsection of 21 U.S.C. § 841 the Government would have charged.
Take Harris's case as an example. A court considering a reduced sentence as if the Fair Sentencing Act was in effect when he committed his offense must engage in a simple three-step analysis. First, it would consider the amount of crack cocaine attributable to him—33.6 grams. Second, it would determine the relevant threshold amount—28 grams or more. And third, it would consider the statutory penalty associated with that threshold amount—5 to 40 years' imprisonment. That statutory penalty range is the same as for Harris's 2007 conviction. So he is not eligible for a reduction under § 404. To consider only the charged conduct in Harris's case—"five grams or more"—would conflict with the plain meaning of the statutory text and ignore the reality of Harris's offense.
The Majority contends that considering actual conduct requires the "problematic" speculation of how the Government would have prosecuted a violation post-Fair Sentencing Act. Maj. Op. 16. That may be true in some cases, and any lack of uncertainty in that regard should entitle the petitioner to a fresh review by the trial judge. But in many other cases—like the two before us here—the district courts won't have much speculating to do. Here, Harris admitted to possessing 33.6 grams and the uncontroverted record showed that Jackson possessed 48 grams. Because Harris and Jackson both possessed more than 28 grams but less than 280 grams, they were chargeable with "28 grams or more."
The Supreme Court's decision in Dorsey v. United States, 567 U.S. 260, 132 S. Ct. 2321, 183 L. Ed. 2d 250 (2012) also suggests we should consider an offender's actual conduct. There, the Court held that the Fair Sentencing Act's "new, more lenient mandatory minimum provisions do apply topre-Act offenders" convicted, but not yet sentenced, when the Act took effect. Id. at 264. In so concluding, the Court considered the offender's actual conduct, saying:
With this background in mind, we turn to the relevant facts of the cases before us. Corey Hill, one of the petitioners, unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in March 2007, before the Fair Sentencing Act became law. . . . Under the 1986 Drug Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of crack was subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2006 ed.). Hill was not sentenced, however, until December 2010, after the Fair Sentencing Act became law and after the new Guidelines amendments had become effective. . . . Under the Fair Sentencing Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of crack was subject to a 5-year, not a 10-year, minimum.  § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).
Id. at 270 (emphasis added). Significantly, the Court did not say "an offender convicted of selling fifty grams or more was subject to a 5-year, not a 10-year, minimum." Rather, the Court used the offender's actual conduct when discussing whether the penalty for that conduct had changed. We should do the same here.
Finally, the meaning of "statutory penalty" and the evolution of the Fair Sentencing Act also support interpreting "covered offense" to refer to an offender's actual conduct. A "statutory penalty" is (unsurprisingly) "[a] penalty imposed for a statutory violation." Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). The Majority characterizes the Fair Sentencing Act's quantity threshold amendments as amendments to statutory penalties. Maj. Op. 17-18. I cannot square that characterization with the statutory text or a commonsense definition of "statutory penalty."
Congress did not amend the penalties for crack cocaine offenses in the Fair Sentencing Act; it retained the previous mandatory penalty ranges while amending the threshold drug amounts that trigger those penalties. It follows that "the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010" must modify "violation" or "violation of a Federal criminal statute" because the Fair Sentencing Act modified the quantities that trigger certain penalties, not the penalties themselves. In other words, the Fair Sentencing Act changed the penalties for certain "violations," or acts. It did not change the penalties for the "Federal criminal statute"—they remained the same.
Taken together, these textual cues support an interpretation based on an offender's actual conduct rather than the statute of conviction.
B
The Majority offers three principal reasons in support of its interpretation, but I find each one wanting.
First, the Majority relies on the "last antecedent rule" to support its interpretation that "the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010" modifies only "Federal criminal statute." Maj. Op. 10. That rule instructs that modifiers usually attach to the closest noun. See Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47, 56, 127 S. Ct. 625, 166 L. Ed. 2d 462 (2006). Generally, courts should not interpret statutes to "divorce a noun from the modifier next to it without some extraordinary reason." Id.
I have no quarrel with this rule in general, but I disagree with its application here. The Majority concludes that "Federal criminal statute" is the closest noun to the modifier. But it's more reasonable to read the modifier as applying to "violation of a Federal criminal statute" because "that clause hangs together as a unified whole, referring to a single thing." Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver Cty. Emp. Ret. Fund, 138 S. Ct. 1061, 1077, 200 L. Ed. 2d 332 (2018). That's why the Supreme Court declined to apply the last antecedent rule in Cyan "when the modifier directly follows a concise and 'integrated' clause." Id. (citation omitted).
Here, "violation of a Federal criminal statute" is a "concise and integrated clause." In this statutory scheme, it would be anomalous to separate "violation" from "Federal criminal statute" in § 404(a) because penalties attach to violations and the Fair Sentencing Act modified conduct thresholds, not the actual penalties.
Second, my colleagues emphasize Congress's use of the past tense ("were modified") in the penalties clause. Maj. Op. 12.  They conclude that the penalties clause cannot apply to violations because the non-retroactive Fair Sentencing Act could not have "modified" the penalty imposed for a "violation" "committed before August 3, 2010." Id. Although this reading of the statute is plausible, the better reading suggests that "were modified" refers to the statutory penalties associated with specific violations that the Fair Sentencing Act modified ten years ago.
Finally, the Majority reasons that considering actual drug quantities renders § 404's reference to "statute" and "statutory penalties" superfluous. Maj. Op. 11-12. But Congress's use of "statute" and "statutory penalties" makes perfect sense if we read "violation of a Federal criminal statute" as an integrated whole. Congress did not modify any penalties, just the drug weights triggering them. So as long as we interpret "statutory penalties for which" as referring to a "violation of a Federal criminal statute," there is no superfluity.
For these reasons, I disagree with the Majority's conclusion that canons of interpretation suggest that § 404 eligibility turns on an offender's statute of conviction instead of his actual conduct.
C
When interpreting a statute we also consider "the design of the statute as a whole and its object and policy," United States v. Schneider, 14 F.3d 876, 879 (3d Cir. 1994), "and avoid constructions that produce 'odd' or 'absurd results' or that are 'inconsistent with common sense.' See Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 454, 109 S. Ct. 2558, 105 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1989) (internal quotations omitted)." Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 539 F.3d 199, 210 (3d Cir. 2008).
The Majority's interpretation of § 404 not only undermines the goals of the Fair Sentencing Act and the First Step Act, it also opens the door to absurd results. Congress enacted the Fair Sentencing Act to "restore fairness to Federal cocaine sentencing" by reducing sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenders. See 124 Stat. at 2372. And in passing the First Step Act, Congress meant to extend the Fair Sentencing Act to crack offenders sentenced before the Fair Sentencing Act. See S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 115th Cong., The First Step Act of 2018 (S.3649), at 2 (Nov. 15, 2018), https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S.%203649%20First%20Step%20Act%20Summary%20-%20As%20Introduced.pdf (remarking § 404 would "bring sentences imposed prior to 2010 in line with sentences imposed after the Fair Sentencing Act was passed"). The interpretation adopted by the Majority does the opposite.
Instead of avoiding sentence disparities and bringing pre-Fair Sentencing Act crack sentences in line with sentences imposed thereafter, the Majority's interpretation will invite greater disparities and give some offenders a windfall. Take these cases. Today's decision makes Harris eligible for a reduced sentence even though he admitted to possessing 33.6 grams of crack cocaine, simply because he was convicted and sentenced before August 3, 2010. Jackson gets the same opportunity even though police found him asleep at the wheel in possession of 48 grams of crack. But a defendant convicted and sentenced in 2011 for possessing 29 grams of crack—less weight than both Harris and Jackson—would not be eligible for a reduced sentence. Congress could not have intended such disparate treatment.
As that example reveals, the Majority's interpretation will not "bring sentences imposed prior to 2010 in line with sentences imposed after the Fair Sentencing Act was passed." Instead, it empowers sentencing judges to treat those convicted before 2010  more favorably than those convicted thereafter. The Majority emphasizes that relief under § 404 is discretionary. Maj. Op. 15. True enough, but the fact remains that district judges around the country—some, not all—will reduce sentences for pre-August 3, 2010 offenders, while offenders who committed the same or lesser offenses afterwards will have no such opportunity. In doing so, those courts will accomplish the opposite of what Congress intended in the First Step Act.
The Supreme Court's Dorsey opinion is instructive once again. In holding that the Fair Sentencing Act's new threshold amounts applied to offenders not yet sentenced on August 3, 2010, the Court explained that
applying the 1986 Drug Act's old mandatory minimums to the post-August 3 sentencing of pre-August 3 offenders would create disparities of a kind that Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentencing Act to prevent. Two individuals with the same number of prior offenses who each engaged in the same criminal conduct involving the same amount of crack and were sentenced at the same time would receive radically different sentences.
567 U.S. at 276-77 (emphasis added). The problem identified by the Court in Dorsey applies here too.
The "actual conduct" approach serves the purpose of aligning pre-2010 sentences with post-2010 sentences without sweeping more broadly than Congress intended. Although that approach means Harris and Jackson are ineligible for a reduction because their sentences match post-2010 sentences for the same drug quantities, thousands of other offenders would be entitled to relief.2  For example, all offenders who possessed 6 to 27 grams of crack in 2000 and were subject to a 5-year mandatory minimum are now eligible for a sentence reduction because those weights do not trigger a mandatory minimum under the Fair Sentencing Act.
In sum, § 404 is far from clear. But when one considers the statute's text, context, and its history, the balance tips in favor of evaluating actual conduct to determine eligibility for a sentence reduction. Indeed, this is the only approach that accomplishes Congress's twin goals of offering a chance at a reduced sentence for certain crack offenders who violated the drug laws in ways ameliorated by the Fair Sentencing Act and reducing sentencing disparities. Because the violations committed by Harris and Jackson are not "covered  offenses" under the statute, I respectfully dissent.
