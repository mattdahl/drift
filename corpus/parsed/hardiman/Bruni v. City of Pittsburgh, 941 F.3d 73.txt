I join the Court's opinion because it rightly construes the Pittsburgh Ordinance to allow conversation on a public sidewalk. I write separately to highlight the impact of Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 192 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2015). In my view, Reed weakened precedents cited in the Court's content neutrality analysis and will constrain Pittsburgh's enforcement of the Ordinance going forward.
I
It is true that the Supreme Court has held that restricting "congregating, picketing, patrolling, [and] demonstrating" around abortion clinics is facially content neutral. Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 759, 757-65, 114 S. Ct. 2516, 129 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1994); see Op. 26-27. The Court has even extended this content neutrality to "wildly expansive definitions" of "demonstrate" and "picket." Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 744, 120 S. Ct. 2480, 147 L. Ed. 2d 597 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see id. at 721-22 (majority opinion) ("defining 'demonstrate' as 'to make a public display of sentiment for or against a person or cause' and 'picket' as an effort 'to persuade or otherwise influence'" (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 600, 1710 (1993))); see also Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of W. N.Y., 519 U.S. 357, 374 n.6, 381-82, 117 S. Ct. 855, 137 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1997) (upholding injunction against "demonstrating," even though it would target some "stationary, nonobstructive demonstrations").
The continued vitality of this content neutrality analysis is questionable after Reed. Before Reed, the Court vacillated between two tests for content neutrality. See generally Genevieve Lakier, Reed v Town of Gilbert, Arizona, and the Rise of the Anticlassificatory First Amendment, 2016 Sup. Ct. Rev. 233; Elena Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413 (1996). In cases like Hill, Schenck, and Madsen, the "government's purpose [w]as the threshold consideration." Madsen, 512 U.S. at 763; see Hill, 530 U.S. at 719; Schenck, 519 U.S. at 371-74 & n.6 (relying solely on Madsen to hold injunction content neutral). But in other cases, the Court's first consideration was whether a law "draw[s] content-based distinctions on its face." McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.S. 464, 479, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 189 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2014). Any law that did so was necessarily content based, no matter the government's purpose. See, e.g., Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 116-17, 122, 112 S. Ct. 501, 116 L. Ed. 2d 476 n.* (1991).
Reed adopted the latter test for content neutrality. It held that "[a] law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government's benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of 'animus toward the ideas contained' in the regulated speech." 135 S. Ct. at 2228 (quoting Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 429, 113 S. Ct. 1505, 123 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1993)); see id. at 2237-39 (Kagan, J., concurring in the judgment). By doing so, Reed "overturn[ed] the standard that [the Court] had previously used to resolve a particular class of cases"—a class that includes cases like this one and Hill. Brian A. Garner et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 31 (2016) (citing Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 66-67, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996), and Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 947 F.2d 682, 691-93 (3d Cir. 1991), aff 'd in part, rev'd in part, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992)). In fact, Reed rebuked Hill several times: by noting that the errant Court of Appeals relied on it, 135 S. Ct. at 2226; and by favorably citing dissents in Hill authored by Justices Scalia and Kennedy, id. at 2229.
Reed also seems to have expanded the types of laws that are facially content based. Facial distinctions, the Court explained, may not only be "obvious, defining regulated speech by particular subject matter." Id. at 2227. They may also be "subtle, defining regulated speech by its function or purpose." Id. Two cases discussed in Reed exemplify this subtle content discrimination.
The first, Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., involved a law that restricted the sale, disclosure, and use of information about drug prescriptions. See 564 U.S. 552, 563-64,  131 S. Ct. 2653, 180 L. Ed. 2d 544 (2011); Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2227. The Court held content based a provision that allowed the sale of that information for "'educational communications,'" but not for "marketing." Sorrell, 564 U.S. at 564 (quoting Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 18, § 4631(e)(4) (Supp. 2010)). "[E]ducation[ ]" and "marketing" are examples of speech's "function or purpose" under Reed. 135 S. Ct. at 2227. They explain how or why a speaker speaks, not what is said. Id.
The second case that underscores the protection afforded to speech's function or purpose is NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 83 S. Ct. 328, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1963). See Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2229. In that case, Virginia "attempt[ed] to use a statute prohibiting 'improper solicitation' by attorneys to outlaw litigation-related speech of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People." Id. (quoting Button, 371 U.S. at 438). The Button Court rejected that attempt, holding that "advocacy" and "'the opportunity to persuade to action'" are First Amendment rights. 371 U.S. at 437-38 (quoting Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 537, 65 S. Ct. 315, 89 L. Ed. 430 (1945)). Describing the Virginia law over 50 years later, the Reed Court called it "facially content-based." 135 S. Ct. at 2229.
So Reed demands that we construe the Ordinance narrowly. And it steers us away from precedents that focused on a law's purpose rather than its facial effect. For laws once held content neutral because of purpose may well be facially content based after Reed. Compare, e.g., Hill, 530 U.S. at 720-21 (holding content neutral a ban on "picketing," "demonstrating," "protest, education, or counseling" even though it may require the government "to review the content of the statements made"), with McCullen, 573 U.S. at 479 ("The [buffer zone law] would be content based if it required 'enforcement authorities' to 'examine the content of the message that is conveyed . . . .'" (quoting FCC v. League of Women Voters of Ca., 468 U.S. 364, 383, 104 S. Ct. 3106, 82 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1984))), and Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2227-29 (highlighting facially content based laws that target solicitation and educational communications). Even some purposes previously held content neutral may now be content based. Compare, e.g., Hill, 530 U.S. at 716 (citing "[t]he unwilling listener's interest in avoiding unwanted communication"), and Turco v. City of Englewood, 935 F.3d 155, 162, 166-67 (3d Cir. 2019) (citing that interest to support narrow tailoring of concededly content neutral law), with McCullen, 573 U.S. at 481 ("To be clear, the Act would not be content neutral if it were concerned with undesirable effects that arise from 'the direct impact of speech on its audience' or '[l]isteners' reactions to speech.'" (quoting Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 321, 108 S. Ct. 1157, 99 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1988))), and Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2227 (protecting speech's "function or purpose").
II
Today our Court does what Reed requires. We hold that "[b]ecause the Ordinance, as properly interpreted, does not extend to sidewalk counseling—or any other calm and peaceful one-on-one conversations," the City cannot examine the content of a conversation to decide whether a violation has occurred. Op. 27-28. It will instead examine, for example, decibel level, the distance between persons, the number of persons, the flow of traffic, and other things usually unrelated to the content or intent of speech. See, e.g., Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2228 (confirming that banning sound amplification is content neutral); id. at 2232 (stating that "entirely forbidding the  posting of signs" is content neutral); McCullen, 573 U.S. at 491-92 (collecting laws that, by penalizing conduct like obstruction or assault, may pass intermediate scrutiny).
The Court's decision constrains the City's enforcement discretion. Pittsburgh cannot target quiet conversations even if they are not in a tone of "kindness, love, hope, gentleness, and help." Op. 11 n.6 (quoting JA 574a); see, e.g., id. at 25-26. It must allow not only conversations that help and love, but also those that serve any other "function or purpose" within the bounds of protected speech. Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2227; see, e.g., id. at 2228-29 (discussing Sorrell, 564 U.S. at 563-64 ("educati[ng]" and "marketing"), and Button, 371 U.S. at 438-40 ("solicit[ing]," "advoca[ting]," and "urg[ing]")).
And the City's enforcement of the Ordinance must be evenhanded. Consider clinic employees and agents who, under the injunction issued in Brown v. City of Pittsburgh, can "congregate" or "patrol" when helping persons enter or exit a clinic. See 586 F.3d 263, 273-75 (3d Cir. 2009); Brown v. City of Pittsburgh, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52927, 2010 WL 2207935, at *2 n.2 (W.D. Pa. May 27, 2010); JA 1324a (permanent injunction order). Before today, the City's broad and amorphous interpretation of the Ordinance risked allowing those employees to engage in speech that others could not. That sort of disparate treatment would now be content or viewpoint based. See Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2230 (citing Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995), and Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010)). Our decision today clarifies that the words "congregate" and "patrol" address conduct—the assembly of people in one place or the action of pacing back and forth. See Op. 25. So interpreted, the Brown injunction's narrow exception does not discriminate between types of speech.
With these understandings, I join the Court's opinion.
