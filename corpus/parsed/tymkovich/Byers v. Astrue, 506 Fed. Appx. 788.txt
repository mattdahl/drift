I dissent because I am persuaded the ALJ did not err in denying benefits. I agree in substantial part with the analysis of the magistrate judge in his report and recommendation and the district court in its order. In my view, the nearly six-month time frame to the claimant's fifty-fifth birthday is not a "few" months as contemplated by the borderline age regulations. 20 C.F.R. ยง 404.1563(b).
