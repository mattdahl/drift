I join Judge Briscoe's opinion. I write separately only to discuss Tenth Circuit jurisprudence for evaluating substantive due process claims.
 I. Substantive Due Process
The Fourteenth Amendment commands that "[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Courts have interpreted this to mean states cannot deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without providing fair procedures. See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).
Yet the Supreme Court has held this interpretation does not adequately address the full spectrum of interactions arising between citizens and their government. Accordingly, the due process guaranteed  by the Fourteenth Amendment covers "more than fair process." Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997). There is a "substantive" aspect too, through which the Clause "protect[s] against arbitrary and oppressive government action." Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City, 528 F.3d 762, 767 (10th Cir. 2008) (citing County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845-46, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998)).
There are two ways a state's action might be arbitrary enough to violate substantive due process. First, when a state law infringes a right without sufficient justification. Second, when state officials deprive a person of life, liberty, or property in a way so arbitrary that it "shocks the conscience." See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1987) ("[S]ubstantive due process prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the conscience or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." (internal quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis added)).
The Supreme Court has developed two strands of jurisprudence to address these two challenges to state action. Under the 'rights' line of substantive due process cases, a state must have a constitutionally sufficient reason before its legislation can interfere with rights to life, liberty, or property. How good a reason a state needs depends on how important the right is. When the right asserted is not "fundamental," a state need only have a legitimate interest reasonably related to the legislation that interferes with those rights. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722. But if the right is "fundamental," the state's interference must be "narrowly tailored" to serve a compelling interest. Id. at 721.
The second strand of substantive due process law addresses arbitrary conduct by a state official or entity. Because every kind of tort imaginable could become a due process violation if perpetrated by a state actor, "only the most egregious official conduct" can give rise to this kind of substantive due process violation. Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998). The Supreme Court has therefore held that a government official's conduct depriving a person of life, liberty, or property violates substantive due process only if it "shocks the conscience." Id.
 II. Challenging Government Action
The parties in this case disagree about how courts apply the 'rights' approach and the 'shocks the conscience' approach. They are not the only ones. The Supreme Court itself has vacillated to and fro. And the circuits have adopted varying approaches.1  Our Circuit has settled on the following solution: if the case involves a legislative act, only the 'rights' strand applies. Dias v. City & County of Denver, 567 F.3d 1169, 1182 (10th Cir. 2009). On the other hand, when the case involves executive action by  a government official or entity, we apply the 'shocks the conscience' test. Browder v. City of Albuquerque, 787 F.3d 1076, 1079 & n.1 (10th Cir. 2015) (negligence context).
Although the distinction between the two tests was not always clear, the Supreme Court attempted to draw a bright line in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846-49. The "criteria to identify what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it is legislation or a specific act of a governmental officer that is at issue," the Court explained. Id. at 846. When a claim involves the specific act of a government officer, courts must first determine whether the officer's conduct was egregious enough to shock the conscience. Id. at 847 n.8. See Nathan S. Chapman & Michael W. McConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L.J. 1672, 1788 (2012) (explaining Lewis's holding "that substantive due process claims against the executive—usually law enforcement officers—are governed by a 'shocks the conscience' test"). Conduct "shocks the conscience" when it demonstrates such "a degree of outrageousness and a magnitude of potential or actual harm" that it "'shocks the conscience of federal judges.'" Uhlrig v. Harder, 64 F.3d 567, 573-74 (10th Cir. 1995) (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 126, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1992)).
But Lewis left some questions unanswered. The Court did not make clear whether the 'rights' approach could still be applied in a case involving executive conduct that shocked the conscience. Then, in Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 123 S. Ct. 1994, 155 L. Ed. 2d 984 (2003), a three-justice plurality applied both the 'shocks the conscience' approach and the 'rights' approach in a case involving a coerced confession. Id. at 774-76. It thus appeared at least a few members of the Supreme Court thought both tests could be used to evaluate executive action.
In Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City, 528 F.3d 762, 767 (10th Cir. 2008), a post-Chavez case, we took this approach. Relying on Chavez, we reasoned that "[a]lthough some precedential support exists for the executive versus legislative distinction," the Supreme Court had not followed "an overly rigid demarcation between the two lines of cases." Id. at 767. We also relied on an earlier Tenth Circuit case explaining that "[w]hile the shocks the conscience standard applies to tortious conduct challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment," it does not "eliminate more categorical protection for fundamental rights as defined by the tradition and experience of the nation." Id. at 769 (quoting Dubbs v. Head Start, Inc., 336 F.3d 1194, 1203 (10th Cir. 2003)). Our court thus concluded the tests were "not mutually exclusive" and "[b]oth approaches" could "be applied in any given case." Id.
A subsequent case, Dias v. City and County of Denver, 567 F.3d 1169 (10th Cir. 2009), clarified that Seegmiller's 'both tests work' rationale only applied to cases challenging government official conduct, not legislation. The court explained: "[w]e held in Seegmiller that application of a 'shocks the conscience' standard in cases involving executive action is not to the exclusion of the foregoing ['rights'] framework." Id. at 1182 (emphasis in original). But the court "clarif[ied] . . . that when legislative action is at issue," only the 'rights' approach "is applicable." Id.
Finally, in Browder v. City of Albuquerque, 787 F.3d 1076 (10th Cir. 2015), we explained that Seegmiller's 'both tests work' interpretation of Chavez was dicta. Id. at 1079 n.1. While we acknowledged that "some question lingers about all this,"  we reasoned that "Chavez did not expressly overrule Lewis's holding that the 'arbitrary or conscience shocking' test is the appropriate one for executive action." Id. Consequently, when a case involves government official conduct, the 'shocks the conscience' test is the only test we apply.2 
This makes sense. Though the 'shocks the conscience' test helps limit the number and types of torts by government actors from becoming substantive due process claims, it is too vague to be useful for evaluating the propriety of legislation. Conversely, the 'rights' approach provides a helpful framework for evaluating statutes, but it cannot well distinguish between innocent and egregious government official conduct. Were we to apply the 'rights' approach to every case of negligence resulting in death, we would come close to converting a broad spectrum of merely negligent government conduct into substantive due process violations.
In sum, then, though our circuit has sometimes repeated Seegmiller's 'both tests work' dicta,3  we do not follow it. Instead, we follow a simple binary approach. If a claim challenges executive action, we apply only the 'shocks the conscience' test; if a claim challenges a legislative act, we apply only the 'rights' approach.
 III. The Claims Here
Having explained how the two strands of substantive due process doctrine work and when our court applies them, I turn to their application in this case.
The facts are simple. As Judge Briscoe recounts, police arrested Kenneth Jerome Dawson for violating a restraining order and kept him in custody at the Jefferson County Jail. Because of County policy, the Jail did not fit Dawson with a GPS tracker over the weekend, and he remained in jail. Dawson argues application of this policy to his circumstances violated his substantive due process right to freedom from bodily restraint.
To state a claim for municipal liability against the County, Dawson must allege the existence of (1) an official policy or custom; (2) a direct causal link between the policy or custom and the constitutional injury alleged; and (3) deliberate indifference on the part of the municipality. Schneider v. City of Grand Junction Police Dep't, 717 F.3d 760, 769 (10th Cir.2013). "[A] formal regulation or policy statement" qualifies as an official policy or custom. Bryson v. City of Okla. City, 627 F.3d 784, 788 (10th Cir. 2010). And no one disagrees there is a direct link between the policy and Dawson's injury. Thus, since "fault and causation [are] obvious" when a decision "duly promulgated" by the city is  unconstitutional, Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 406, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1997), the entire question in this case boils down to whether Jefferson County's enacted policy violated Dawson's substantive due process rights.
Since the Board of County Commissioners adopted the challenged policy by resolution, the policy is legislative. We therefore apply the 'rights' approach under Dias. See 567 F.3d at 1182.
Under the 'rights' approach, if a government action "burdens a fundamental right, the infringement must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest," but if it "burdens some lesser right, the infringement is merely required to bear a rational relation to a legitimate government interest." Id. at 1181 (citing Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721, 728). Dawson argues the County's policies violated his right to freedom from bodily restraint by causing him to stay in jail over the weekend. He claims that Supreme Court cases establish this right is a fundamental one, and that the administrative convenience the County obtains from its policy is not a sufficiently compelling interest.
Dawson attempts to do here what the Supreme Court cautioned courts to watch out for—he attempts to convert his injury into a violation of a 'fundamental right' by articulating the right at too high a level of generality. It was precisely to prevent this strategy that Glucksberg instructs us to look for a "'careful description' of the asserted fundamental liberty interest." 521 U.S. at 721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993)). The right Dawson claims the County violated is not a right to freedom from bodily restraint, writ large, but a right to speedy release from pretrial detention when the only remaining unfulfilled condition for release is within the jail's control.
The Supreme Court has evaluated pretrial confinement schemes under substantive due process doctrine in several cases. See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1987); Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 104 S. Ct. 2403, 81 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1984). In those cases, instead of applying strict scrutiny, the Court applied the substantive due process test from Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979), which only asks whether the government had a rational basis for its policy or instead meant its policy as punishment, id. at 535, 538-39. See Salerno, 481 U.S. at 746-47; Schall, 467 U.S. at 269. By choosing not to apply strict scrutiny, the Court implied that pretrial confinement not intended as punishment does not infringe a fundamental right.
Indeed, the Court's language in Bell strongly indicates strict scrutiny analysis would be wrong in the pretrial detention context. "In evaluating the constitutionality of conditions or restrictions of pretrial detention that implicate only the protection against deprivation of liberty without due process of law," the Court said, "we think that the proper inquiry is whether those conditions amount to punishment of the detainee." Id. at 535 (emphasis added).
It must be acknowledged, though, the Supreme Court's analysis in Salerno was certainly not as clear as it could be.4  We are therefore not surprised the Ninth Circuit came to the opposite conclusion recently—holding there is a fundamental  right to freedom from pretrial detention. See Lopez-Valenzuela v. Arpaio, 770 F.3d 772, 781 (9th Cir. 2014). Dawson points to that case for support.
I think our analysis is the correct one, however, both for the reasons already stated and for two additional reasons. First, this case more helpfully places the Bell, Schall, and Salerno line of cases squarely within the overarching substantive due process 'rights' approach the Supreme Court announced in Glucksberg. See 521 U.S. at 721, 728. The Ninth Circuit's conclusion, by contrast, creates an additional, sui generis due process framework. See Lopez-Valenzuela, 770 F.3d at 780 ("We first consider whether the . . . laws satisfy general substantive due process principles . . . [w]e then consider in the alternative whether the . . . laws violate due process, under Bell, Schall and Salerno, by imposing punishment before trial."). Second, our decision keeps federal courts from supervising all pretrial detention policies. Were we to find a right as broad as the Ninth Circuit suggests, all jail procedures relating to bail could become subject to strict scrutiny.
In sum, the right Dawson alleges is best characterized as a non-fundamental right to be free from pretrial punishment. We thus need only apply rational basis scrutiny as directed by Bell. And as the majority explains, the County's policy meets that standard. Cf. Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 145, 99 S. Ct. 2689, 61 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1979) ("we are quite certain that a detention of three days over a New Year's weekend does not and could not amount to deprivation [of due process]").
A weekend in jail is no small burden. The County can likely do better. But its policy does not violate the Constitution.
