, with whom Judges NIEMEYER, AGEE, and QUATTLEBAUM join, dissenting:
I respectfully dissent. This Court's authority to vacate a guilty plea and conviction is strictly circumscribed where, as here, the defendant did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court or attempt to bring the errors complained of on appeal to the district court's attention in any fashion. The limits on our authority are not discretionary—they are imposed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Supreme Court decisions, and precedent from this Court. In my view, faithful application of those limits requires affirmance. Lockhart has not satisfied his burden to show that the Rule 11 error or the Rehaif error, separately or combined, affected his substantial rights.
I.
If a defendant believes that an error has occurred to his detriment in a federal criminal proceeding, "he must object in order to preserve the issue." Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 134, 129 S. Ct. 1423, 173 L. Ed. 2d 266 (2009); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(b). "If he fails to do so in a timely manner, his claim for relief from the error is forfeited." Puckett, 556 U.S. at 134; see United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993); Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 444, 64 S. Ct. 660, 88 L. Ed. 834 (1944). "If an error is not properly preserved, appellate-court authority to remedy the error . . . is strictly circumscribed." Puckett, 556 U.S. at 134.
Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure creates "a limited exception" to the appellate preclusion that follows a defendant's forfeiture of an error in the district court. Puckett, 556 U.S. at 135. Under Rule 52(b), "[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court's attention." The Supreme Court has instructed that so-called "plain-error review" has four requirements: (1) an error; (2) that is clear; (3) that affected the defendant's "substantial rights," which ordinarily requires that the error "'affected the outcome'" of the proceedings; and (4) that "'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity[,] or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'" Puckett, 556 U.S. at 135 (first alteration in original) (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 736). If the first three requirements are not satisfied, a court of appeals "ha[s] no authority to correct" the error. Olano, 507 U.S. at 741. Even if those requirements are satisfied, the court may remedy the error at its discretion only if the fourth requirement is also satisfied. Puckett, 556 U.S. at 135; Olano, 507 U.S. at 732. The defendant bears the burden of establishing entitlement to relief at every step of the analysis. United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 82, 124 S. Ct. 2333, 159 L. Ed. 2d 157 (2004); see United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S. Ct. 1043, 152 L. Ed. 2d 90 (2002).
To establish the prejudice required at the third step of this analysis, "a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error [in accepting his plea] under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea." Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 83. Relief on appeal from a guilty plea is "difficult to get" under this standard, "as it should be." Id. at 83 n.9. By design, this standard "demand[s]  strenuous exertion to get relief for unpreserved error," in order to "encourage timely objections," "reduce wasteful reversals," and accord proper respect to "the finality of guilty pleas," which are "indispensable" to "the modern criminal justice system" and "usually rest, after all, on a defendant's profession of guilt in open court." Id. at 82-83. An appellate court must consider "the entire record," not merely the plea hearing, in assessing whether the defendant has carried his burden to show that it is reasonably probable he would not have pleaded guilty absent the error. Id. at 83; see Vonn, 535 U.S. at 59.
II.
Lockhart pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment applicable to his crime in light of his history as an armed career criminal. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). On appeal, Lockhart identifies two errors in the district court proceedings that he did not raise below. First, during the plea colloquy, the magistrate judge did not advise Lockhart of the increased sentence he could face because of his potential eligibility under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). I agree with the majority that this was a clear error under Rule 11(b)(1)(H) and (I). See United States v. Hairston, 522 F.3d 336, 340-341 (4th Cir. 2008) (holding that, although a district court "could not [be] certain" about whether ACCA would apply at the time of a Rule 11 proceeding, the court nevertheless must "anticipate the possibility" and inform the defendant ACCA "could" potentially apply). Second, no one informed Lockhart that the crime to which he pleaded guilty required the Government to prove, or Lockhart to admit, that he knew, when he possessed the firearm, that he had previously been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. I agree with the majority that, in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Rehaif v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2191, 204 L. Ed. 2d 594 (2019), this was also an error that was clear by the time of our en banc deliberation in this case. I part ways with the majority at the third step of the analysis—the prejudice inquiry. Lockhart has not shown a reasonable probability that, but for these errors, he would not have entered his plea.
A.
Beginning with the Rule 11 error, the Court must consider the entire record to determine whether Lockhart has shown a reasonable probability that, but for the magistrate judge's failure to correct the Government's misstatement of Lockhart's sentencing exposure during the plea colloquy, he would not have pleaded guilty. See Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 83. The Court is not at liberty to "upset a plea solely because of post hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded" absent the error; rather, the Court must "look to contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant's expressed preferences." Lee v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 1958, 1967, 198 L. Ed. 2d 476 (2017). As the Supreme Court has instructed, the Court should consider evidence that Lockhart was correctly informed elsewhere about his sentencing exposure. See Vonn, 535 U.S. at 75 (considering evidence that the defendant was informed of his right to trial counsel before the plea proceeding); Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 84-85 (requiring consideration of "other facts that may have borne on [the defendant's] choice regardless of any Rule 11 error").
 During his arraignment proceeding—before he entered a plea—Lockhart was correctly advised that "the ordinary maximum punishment is up to 10 years['] imprisonment" but that, "if [he had] three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, the minimum term would be 15 years and the maximum sentence [would be] life imprisonment." J.A. 13. The Government specifically advised that, "[w]hile his criminal history [had not] been computed," the Government "[thought] that [the enhanced penalty] might indeed apply here." J.A. 13. In response, Lockhart's counsel previewed that he "would argue that it's 10 years." J.A. 15.
The presentence report—prepared after Lockhart pleaded guilty—correctly advised Lockhart that, under ACCA, he was subject to a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum of life. J.A. 80-82, 86. The presentence report specifically noted that, during the plea hearing, Lockhart had been misinformed that his maximum sentencing exposure was 10 years in prison when in fact his mandatory minimum sentence was 15 years. J.A. 87. Lockhart received the presentence report and filed objections, including objecting to the application of ACCA on the grounds that he was a juvenile at the time of the predicate offenses and that the offenses were part of one continuous string of robberies. J.A. 63-64. But Lockhart never objected to the application of ACCA on the ground that he had been misinformed about his sentencing exposure at the time he pleaded guilty. Nor did Lockhart attempt to withdraw his guilty plea after the presentence report correctly informed him of his sentencing range, despite his right to withdraw his plea before sentencing for "a fair and just reason." Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B).
At sentencing, Lockhart was again correctly informed about the mandatory minimum sentence and expressed no surprise or confusion. To the contrary, he confirmed that he had read the presentence report, reviewed it with his attorney, and understood it. The district court sentenced Lockhart to the mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison pursuant to ACCA. After the court pronounced the sentence, Lockhart's counsel asked to confer with the Government's attorney. After he did so, Lockhart's counsel stated: "I'm going back to his plea colloquy. He didn't plead to [ACCA;] it was not on the Bill of Indictment. But I went over it beforehand. So I just want to put it on the record that he was fully aware of that. I just thought about it." J.A. 51-52. That statement is consistent with the record, and no one has questioned counsel's credibility. But see Maj. Op., supra, at 13 ("We have no way of evaluating the credibility of defense counsel's statement."). Lockhart did not dispute the accuracy of his attorney's representation at sentencing, nor has he disputed it on appeal.1  The arraignment, the presentence report, defense counsel's statement, and the absence of any adverse response from Lockhart are powerful indicators that Lockhart would have persisted in his guilty plea even if he had been given correct information about his potential sentencing exposure during the plea hearing.
The Court should also consider "the overall strength of the Government's case and any possible defenses that appear from the record," as the Supreme Court  has instructed. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 85. Police found Lockhart sitting in the front seat of a car with a loaded pistol beside him and an extra magazine in the pocket of the driver's side door. Lockhart told the officers he was trying to push the gun under the seat when they arrived. Lockhart had been convicted of multiple felonies punishable by one year or more in prison at the time he possessed the gun and, as will be discussed, see infra II.B., the evidence indicates that Lockhart knew he was a felon at the time. In light of these facts, one could fairly ask what Lockhart "could gain by going to trial." Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 85. In contrast, by pleading guilty, Lockhart shaved eight months off the bottom of his Guideline sentencing range, moving the range as low as possible in light of the statutory mandatory minimum. Cf. Rosales-Mireles v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1897, 1907, 201 L. Ed. 2d 376 (2018) ("Any amount of actual jail time is significant . . . ." (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).
The majority correctly observes that that the most closely analogous precedent is our decision in United States v. Massenburg, 564 F.3d 337 (4th Cir. 2009). Maj. Op., supra, at 8. Massenburg was also misinformed at his plea hearing that he faced a ten-year maximum prison sentence for pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm when, in fact, ACCA applied and subjected him to a 15-year mandatory minimum. As here, the presentence report included the correct ACCA calculation. The district court sentenced Massenburg to 210 months in prison. On appeal, we concluded that Massenburg had failed to demonstrate prejudice under plain-error review. As the majority correctly summarizes, we emphasized several facts, each of which applies equally here: "(1) Massenburg had not made any statements on the record suggesting that he would not have pleaded guilty if the district court had properly informed him of the sentencing exposure that he faced; (2) Massenburg had not moved to withdraw his guilty plea after learning from the [presentence report] that he could be sentenced under the ACCA; and (3) the parties did not dispute that the evidence of Massenberg's guilt was strong." Maj. Op., supra, at 8 (internal quotations marks and alterations omitted). This Court's decision in Massenburg compels the conclusion that Lockhart also has not carried his burden to demonstrate prejudice.
Indeed, Lockhart's case for prejudice is even weaker than Massenberg's. In addition to the shared facts listed above, Lockhart was correctly informed at his arraignment—before pleading guilty—that ACCA's increased sentencing range could apply to him. And Lockhart's attorney—who attended the arraignment—later represented to the district court in Lockhart's presence that counsel "went over [ACCA] beforehand" with Lockhart and Lockhart "was fully aware" that ACCA's enhanced penalty may apply. J.A. 51-52. In light of Massenburg, Lockhart surely has failed to show "a reasonable probability that, but for the error [at his plea hearing], he would not have entered the plea." Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 83.
The majority attempts to distinguish Massenburg and finds prejudice from the Rule 11 error based on the fact that "ACCA substantially increased Lockhart's sentencing exposure" and "severely restricted any benefit Lockhart could have received by pleading guilty." Maj. Op., supra, at 10-11. Of course, ACCA "substantially increased" Massenburg's sentencing exposure too, and it typically will—that is its purpose. Compare 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2) with 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). And a defendant's  "assessment of his strategic position" certainly is relevant to discerning whether he would have pleaded guilty absent the Rule 11 error. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 85. But in my view, these strategic considerations cannot carry Lockhart's burden in light of the evidence that he was repeatedly correctly informed of his sentencing exposure and yet, despite knowing his strategic position full well, never objected to the Rule 11 error, never moved to withdraw his guilty plea, and never indicated that he would not have pleaded guilty absent the error in his plea hearing.2  To rely on abstract strategic considerations alone and turn a blind eye to countervailing facts in the record about Lockhart's actual decisions in the district court borders on presuming prejudice, and it gives short shrift to the Supreme Court's instruction that the reviewing court's judgment should be "informed by the entire record." Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 83. As we recognized in Massenburg, "[d]efendants plead guilty for various reasons, many of which are wholly unrelated to the length of a potential sentence." 564 F.3d at 344. Lockhart has not told us why he pleaded guilty, and he is not required to. But neither has he given us reason to believe that, but for the magistrate judge's error in the plea hearing, he would not have entered his plea.
B.
Moving to the Rehaif error, I cannot conclude that Lockhart has shown that this error "'affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.'" Puckett, 556 U.S. at 135 (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 734). I assume, as the majority does, that the Rehaif error is subject to plain-error review. See Maj. Op., supra, at 15. Indeed, "while Rehaif's impact is only beginning to be addressed, courts have thus far unanimously applied a plain error standard in addressing convictions obtained before that decision." United States v. Balde, 943 F.3d 73, 92 (2d Cir. 2019). Despite purporting to apply plain-error review, however, the majority does not identify any additional prejudice it believes Lockhart suffered from the Rehaif error. See Maj. Op., supra, at 15. I would hold that Lockhart has not carried his burden.
The Court must again evaluate the error against the entire record. See Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 83; Vonn, 535 U.S. at 59. Lockhart admitted in the factual basis for his plea that he had been convicted of an offense punishable by more than one year in prison and that his firearm rights had not been restored. J.A. 21. The record shows that in 2006, Lockhart pleaded guilty in state court to six counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon and four counts of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. J.A. 72-73; S.J.A. 1-5. The "transcript of plea" from the state court indicates that each of these offenses is a felony and the "maximum punishment" for each is more than one  year of imprisonment. S.J.A. 5. Lockhart received two consecutive sentences of between 38 and 55 months in prison for these convictions, which were consolidated into two judgments. Lockhart spent over six years in prison for these offenses. Roughly three years after his release, Lockhart was arrested on the instant felon-in-possession charge. When the officers arrested Lockhart, he told them that he was trying to push the gun under the seat of the car, apparently to hide it. J.A. 21. And at his sentencing, Lockhart admitted that he "possess[ed] a firearm when [he] knew [he] was a felon," explaining that he kept the gun because he felt "like [his] family's life was in danger." J.A. 47.
This evidence that Lockhart knew he had been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year when he possessed the firearm, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), strongly suggests that he would have persisted in his guilty plea even if he had been correctly instructed in accord with Rehaif. Lockhart argues that, if he had known of this element, he could have decided to put the Government to its proof at trial. But the preceding review of the record "reveals no reason to think that the government would have had any difficulty at all in offering overwhelming proof that [Lockhart] knew that he had previously been convicted of offenses punishable by more than a year in prison." United States v. Burghardt, 939 F.3d 397, 404 (1st Cir. 2019); see Rehaif, 139 S. Ct. at 2198 (noting that a defendant's knowledge of his status can be inferred from circumstantial evidence). Like our sister circuits have held in similar cases concerning Rehaif errors in convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), I would hold that Lockhart has failed to prove the prejudice required to vacate his guilty plea on plain-error review. See Burghardt, 939 F.3d at 405-406 (rejecting challenge to Rehaif error in guilty plea on plain-error review in light of the whole record); United States v. Williams, 776 Fed. Appx. 387, 388 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (same); United States v. Benamor, 937 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2019) (rejecting challenge to Rehaif error in jury trial on plain-error review in light of the whole record); United States v. Hollingshed, 940 F.3d 410, 415-416 (8th Cir. 2019) (same); United States v. Reed, 941 F.3d 1018, 1021 (11th Cir. 2019) (same); United States v. Mancillas, No. 19-1151, 789 Fed. Appx. 549, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 305, 2020 WL 88794, at *1-2 (7th Cir. Jan. 7, 2020) (same); United States v. Johnson, 781 Fed. Appx. 370, 371 (5th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (rejecting challenge to Rehaif error in factual basis for guilty plea on plain-error review in light of the whole record); United States v. Denson, 774 Fed. Appx. 184, 185 (5th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (same); United States v. Fisher, No. 18-3234, 796 Fed. Appx. 504, 2019 WL 6522869, at *5 (10th Cir. Dec. 4. 2019) (same).
C.
Having concluded that Lockhart has failed to show a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty but for the Rule 11 error or the Rehaif error, I also do not find his case for prejudice to be strengthened by combining those errors. "Errors are commonplace, . . . and our affection for procedural perfection cannot operate to the detriment of our commitment to other, equally important, principles of adjudication." Massenburg, 564 F.3d at 345. Those principles include the limits on our power as a reviewing court to remedy unpreserved errors. Because Lockhart has not shown that the errors in this case affected the outcome of the proceedings, this Court "ha[s] no authority to correct [them]." Olano, 507 U.S. at 741. I would affirm.
