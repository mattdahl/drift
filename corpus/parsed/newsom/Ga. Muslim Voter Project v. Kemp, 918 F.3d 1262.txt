On November 2, 2018, I voted to deny then-Secretary Kemp's motion to stay the district court's injunction on the ground that he had not made the requisite showing under Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 173 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2009). I write separately today only to emphasize my belief that our November 2 order refusing the stay says all that needs to be said.
On November 2, we had before us a live "case or controversy," to be sure. The November 2018 election was fast approaching, the district court had entered an injunction to which Kemp objected, and Kemp had filed an appeal and, with it, a motion to stay. We denied the stay, the election went forward, Kemp was elected Governor, and the Office of the Secretary of State has since voluntarily dismissed its appeal of the district court's injunction. So while our November 2 decision was not the least bit "advisory," it seems to me that everything we say today—more than four months after the fact and with so much water under the bridge—is. In my judgment, we should not now opine on issues in a case that, though once live, is now doubly (if not triply) moot—particularly given that nothing we can say at this point could even theoretically provide Kemp the relief he once sought. Cf. Fleming v. Gutierrez, 785 F.3d 442, 445 (10th Cir. 2015) ("We cannot turn back the clock and create a world in which the County does not have to administer the 2014 election under the strictures of the injunction."); Stone v. Bd. of Election Comm'rs for City of Chicago, 643 F.3d 543, 544-45 (7th Cir. 2011) (holding that an appeal of the decision to deny a preliminary injunction was moot "[b]ecause the election has taken place").
