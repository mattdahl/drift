I concur in the Court's revised opinion. For reasons that I've already explained at length and needn't repeat here, I am convinced that 18 U.S.C. ยง 2251(d)(1) is best (if unfortunately) interpreted not to reach Caniff's conduct. It has always seemed pretty obvious to me that when Caniff sent private, person-to-person text messages requesting explicit photos, he didn't "make[]" a "notice" for them. See United States v. Caniff, 916 F.3d 929, 940-48 (11th Cir. 2019) (Newsom, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Having said that, because, at the very least, ยง 2251(d)(1) doesn't clearly cover Caniff's conduct, I am satisfied with the Court's lenity-based resolution.
