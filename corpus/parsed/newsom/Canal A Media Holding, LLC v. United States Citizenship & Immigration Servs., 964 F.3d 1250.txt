I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately only to emphasize (what is to me, anyway) the obvious correctness of the Court's holding that USCIS's denial of Canal A Media's Form I-129 visa petition constituted "final agency action" within the meaning of § 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 704.
In determining whether agency action is "final" for APA purposes, the Supreme Court has emphasized, first and foremost, that "the action must mark the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process," Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78, 117 S. Ct. 1154, 137 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1997) (emphasis added) (quotation omitted), or, alternatively, that "the agency has completed its decisionmaking process," Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797, 112 S. Ct. 2767, 120 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1992) (emphasis added). Those formulations tee up an important—and here, apparently dispositive—question: What is the relevant "agency"? It seems to me self-evident—and so far as I can tell, all agree—that the "agency" whose "decisionmaking process" we have to evaluate here is USCIS, the instrumentality of the federal government responsible for evaluating I-129 petitions. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(l).
The government contends here—and the district court held—that USCIS's denial of Canal A Media's I-129 petition didn't constitute "final agency action" because Mr. Archila, on whose behalf Canal A Media sought the I-129, was still in the middle of removal proceedings before an immigration judge. That is triply wrong—and, it seems to me, at the most basic level(s).
First, the government asks us to agency-jump. USCIS's decisionmaking process hasn't run its course, the government says, because an immigration judge is still working. But USCIS and the immigration court are altogether different "agenc[ies]." Cf. 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1) (defining "agency" to mean "each authority of the Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency"). More than that, they are housed in altogether different departments—USCIS exists within the Department of Homeland Security,1  whereas the immigration court operates under the auspices of the Department of Justice.2  The executive branch has an architecture—granted, not always perfectly elegant, but an architecture  nonetheless—and the government's position defies it.
Second, not only are the agencies themselves different, the participants in the proceedings before them are different. The only party properly before USCIS was Canal A Media, the visa petitioner; Mr. Archila, although the petition's intended beneficiary, was not a party to the I-129 proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(a)(3). Conversely, in the ongoing removal proceedings before the IJ, Mr. Archila is the lone participant; Canal A Media has no right to appear.
Finally, not only are the agencies different, and the parties before them different, but their respective jurisdictions—for purposes of this case, anyway—are different, as well. While USCIS and immigration courts share jurisdiction over a limited range of issues—for instance, eligibility for Temporary Protected Status, see, e.g., Mejia Rodriguez v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., 562 F.3d 1137, 1140 (11th Cir. 2009)—only USCIS has authority to decide Canal A Media's I-129 visa petition, see 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(l)(1)(i); Matter of Aurelio, 19 I. & N. Dec. 458, 460 (BIA 1987). The IJ handling Mr. Archila's removal proceedings has no jurisdiction to consider, grant, or deny Canal A Media's petition, let alone to review USCIS's denial.
At 30,000 feet, then, the government's position just can't be right. USCIS's rejection of Canal A Media's I-129 petition is not non-"final" simply because a different agency that is housed in a different executive-branch department and is vested with jurisdiction over different issues and is presiding over a different proceeding involving a different party hasn't finished its different business.
