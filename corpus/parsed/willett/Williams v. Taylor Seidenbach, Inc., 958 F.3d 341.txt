). As I understand it, the concurrence would allow parties to manufacture finality by "disclaim[ing] the right to reassert dismissed-without-prejudice claims." Ibid. But I cannot find anything in the Federal Rules or § 1291 that allows a party's say-so to turn a non-final decision into a final one. Rather, we must determine our judicial power in every case, irrespective of what the parties might say or do:
The parties cannot confer on a federal court jurisdiction that has not been vested in that court by the Constitution and Congress. This means that the parties cannot waive lack of subject matter jurisdiction by express consent, or by conduct, or even by estoppel. The subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts is too fundamental a concern to be left to the whims and tactical concerns of the litigants.
13 Wright & Miller § 3522 (3d ed.) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted). That's why we don't let parties stipulate away jurisdictional defects. See, e.g., Frank v. Gaos, 139 S. Ct. 1041, 1046, 203 L. Ed. 2d 404 (2019) (per curiam) (noting that, even when parties agree to settle, a court may not exercise the judicial power while questions of standing remain unresolved); Nike, 568 U.S. at 91 (explaining that a plaintiff may not overcome mootness merely by asserting that the case isn't moot); Steel Co., 523 U.S. at  95 (requiring courts to ignore the parties' jurisdictional concessions and make an independent determination as to jurisdiction). Yet the "litigant-disclaimer solution" would convert a decision over which we have no jurisdiction into one over which we do, through nothing more than an appellant's ipse dixit.
Moreover, I worry that the "litigant-disclaimer" proposal causes the problem it seeks to avoid: "vanquish[ing] the finality trap by vanquishing finality." Ante, at 26 (Willett, J., concurring). When is the deadline for a party to transmute-by-disclaimer a without-prejudice dismissal into a with-prejudice final decision? If this case is anything to go by, the answer is "never": The without-prejudice dismissal at issue here was entered in November 2016. Yet the concurrence proposes allowing the Williamses to "bindingly disclaim any right to reassert their voluntarily dismissed claims" on remand to a three-judge panel of this court—no matter that this disclaimer may arrive almost four years after the dismissal. Id. at 32.
Alternatively, if the normal rules apply and the plaintiff must disclaim and appeal within the 30-day deadline to file a notice of appeal from the dismissal, seeFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) & 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), that time came and went three years ago—without any mention of a disclaimer, see Williams v. Lockheed Martin, Corp., No. 16-31238 (5th Cir. Feb. 15, 2017) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal from the Rule 41(a) dismissal after the Williamses "concede[d] that a Rule 54 order is necessary to invoke this court's jurisdiction"). That was the time to determine the finality of the district court's decision. And the Williamses failure to hew to that 30-day deadline carries jurisdictional consequences today. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 213, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007).

We can never forget that the rule of law is the law of rules. See Antonin Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989). And few rules are more important than the ones that limit our jurisdiction and hence legitimize our exercise of it. This case gave us a chance to address the inconsistencies in our jurisdictional precedents, but instead we've made them worse. I hope that we'll come back and fix these errors. Cf. United States v. Castillo-Rivera, 853 F.3d 218, 237 (5th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (Smith, J., dissenting) (observing, of an en banc court's refusal to tackle an issue presented for en banc consideration, that "[r]efusing to take this fork in the road is the easy way, but not the right one"). Until then, I respectfully dissent.
