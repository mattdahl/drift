Justice Willett, joined by Justice Guzman, concurring.
I join all but Part V of the Court's opinion, which addresses whether the Texas Workers' Compensation Act precludes Ruttiger's common-law "good faith and fair dealing" claim. On this point, the Court is divided 4-3-2. Justice Johnson (joined by three colleagues) contends the TWCA's comprehensive regime removes any basis for allowing Aranda-type suits.1  Chief Justice Jefferson (joined by two colleagues) responds that such suits are limited but not abrogated, noting the TWCA (1) eliminates certain bad-faith claims, meaning others survive, and (2) limits exemplary damages in "good faith and fair dealing" suits specifically, meaning other damages remain recoverable.2  My view (shared by Justice Guzman) is decidedly agnostic: As the court of appeals never addressed this issue,3  I would remand it rather than resolve it.
