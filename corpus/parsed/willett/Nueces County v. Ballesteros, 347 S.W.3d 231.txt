JUSTICE WILLETT, dissenting from the denial of the petition for review.
For reasons explained in my concurrence today in Roccaforte v. Jefferson County, 1  respectfully dissent from the Court's denial of Nueces County's petition for review. 
My view in Roccaforte is that Jefferson County effectively waived Roccaforte's noncompliance with the mandatory post-suit notice requirements of Local Government Code Section 89.0041 by failing to raise it "as soon as possible."2  As we have stated, "The failure of a non-jurisdictional requirement mandated by statute may result in the loss of a claim, but that failure must be timely asserted and compliance can be waived."3  In Roccaforte, Jefferson County litigated for two-plus years before asserting defective notice, raising it only after limitations had expired. In this case, however, Nueces County immediately objected to Ballasteros's noncompliance in both it's pleas to the jurisdiction and its motion to dismiss.4  Accordingly, I believe Nueces County was entitled to mandatory dismissal under Section 89.0041(c).5
