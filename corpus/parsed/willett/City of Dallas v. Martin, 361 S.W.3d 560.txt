Justice Willett, dissenting.
For the reasons stated in my dissent in Albert, 354 S.W.3d at 384, 2011 Tex. LEXIS 636, *41, I would decline to reach the issues decided by the Court, and would instead remand to the trial court to consider first whether amendments  to Chapter 271 of the Local Government Code effect a waiver of the City's immunity.
