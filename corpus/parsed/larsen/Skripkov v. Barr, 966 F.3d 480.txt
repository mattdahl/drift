, concurring in the judgment. A person's eligibility for asylum turns, in part, on the subjective motivations of his persecutors. See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S. Ct. 812, 117 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1992); see also 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42) and 1158(b)(1)(A) (authorizing the grant of asylum to persons subject to persecution "on account of" a protected trait). If his persecutors were "motivated by a particular animus" toward his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinions, then he may be eligible for asylum. See Cruz-Guzman v. Barr, 920 F.3d 1033, 1037 (6th Cir. 2019). If, instead, his persecutors' motives were "purely personal," he is ineligible for asylum and may be subject to removal. Marku v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 982, 988 (6th Cir. 2004).
This simple inquiry becomes more challenging when the persecutors' motives were "mixed." See Guzman-Vazquez v. Barr, 959 F.3d 253, 270 (6th Cir. 2020). In such cases, the applicant must establish that his protected trait was "at least one central reason" for his persecution. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). The factfinder's task, then, is to determine whether the applicant's protected trait was a "central" motivation for the persecution, see id., rather than merely "incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for the harm." See Lopez-Arias v. Barr, 777 F. App'x 793, 796 (6th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).
The challenge is further compounded when the protected trait asserted by the applicant is a political opinion against government corruption. Persecution motivated by greed, lost profits, or "the financial demands of criminal corruption" is insufficient. See Khozhaynova v. Holder, 641 F.3d 187, 196 (6th Cir. 2011). Yet, as the majority notes, it is easy for those motives to appear "inextricably intertwined" with animus against the applicant's anti-corruption political beliefs. See Maj. Op. at 8. Sometimes the persecutors will have lost money "precisely because of [the applicant's] political opinion against corruption." See id. The question in such cases is  "whether the persecutor[s] w[ere] attempting to suppress a challenge to the governing institution," or merely "attempting to suppress a challenge . . . to isolated, aberrational acts of greed or malfeasance." Zhang v. Gonzales, 426 F.3d 540, 548 (2d Cir. 2005) (Sotomayor, J.).
In this case, the BIA and IJ determined that Skripkov's persecutors were "motivated only by pecuniary reasons, not by political ones." At first glance, that conclusion seems reasonable. Skripkov testified that his anti-corruption leafletting was merely a "pretext" for his arrests and that, instead, the Russian police persecuted him because he "interfer[ed] with their business interests." He elaborated, "There were a lot of people that had . . . the [anti-corruption] fliers, but I was the one who would get stopped." That testimony would normally end our inquiry. The BIA and IJ's factual findings are conclusive "unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary." See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added). Surely, a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to disregard Skripkov's own testimony.
But Skripkov also testified that the Russian police threatened him with prosecution under Article 212.1 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code. And he claimed that this provision is a "notorious tool[] of government repression of dissent in Russia." If that is true, then I agree with the majority that it could move Skripkov's case "from the sphere of private retaliation into the sphere of political repression." See Maj. Op. at 13. In other words: threatened prosecution under such a law could show that the officers were motivated, at least in part, by a desire to "suppress a challenge to the governing institution." See Zhang, 426 F.3d at 548. That conclusion-if reached-would necessitate a more nuanced mixed-motive analysis than the BIA and IJ conducted below.
We do not know, however, whether Skripkov's description of Article 212.1 is true. Neither the BIA nor the IJ addressed his threatened prosecution under this law below. I, thus, agree with the majority that we should GRANT Skripkov's petition and REMAND for the BIA and IJ to consider the strength and effect of this evidence in the first instance.
