 in part and dissenting in part. I agree with my colleagues' conclusion that Trotter's motion to disqualify the AUSAs should be denied. I also agree that his motion for authorization to file a second or successive motion to vacate should be denied as to his claim that his counsel was ineffective for allowing him to be transferred to state custody. Unlike my colleagues, however, I would hold that Trotter's claim that counsel was ineffective in advising him that he would receive credit for time served in state custody if he entered into the plea agreement is not second or successive. See In re Jones, 652 F.3d 603, 606 (6th Cir. 2010) (evaluating the ripeness of each claim in the motion for authorization to file a successive petition in turn). I read Trotter's claim not as asserting that his plea agreement was not fulfilled, but that he was erroneously assured by his counsel that he would receive the credit, the plea bargain notwithstanding. He could neither have discovered that counsel was wrong, nor shown that he was prejudiced from the advice, until the BOP denied him the credit in March 2017. Therefore, this claim was not ripe when he filed his first ยง 2255 motion. Accordingly, I would dismiss his motion to vacate as unnecessary as to this claim.
