, concurring in the judgment. Pro se litigants enjoy relaxed standards, but even they "must still brief the issues advanced with some effort at developed argumentation." King v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 381 F. App'x 577, 579 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Coleman v. Shoney's Inc., 79 F. App'x 155, 157 (6th Cir. 2003)). Cook's briefing does not meet even this relaxed standard. She merely lists laws that she wishes us to apply, with no attempt at developing any sort of argument based on those laws. She has therefore forfeited her arguments, and for this reason alone, I would affirm the judgment of the district court.
