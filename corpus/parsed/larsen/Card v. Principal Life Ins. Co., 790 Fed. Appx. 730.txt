, dissenting. I agree with the majority that the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review applies in this case. In my view, however, application of that standard requires us to affirm the district court. Arbitrary-and-capricious review is the "least demanding form of judicial review." Donati v. Ford Motor Co., Gen. Ret. Plan, Ret. Comm., 821 F.3d 667, 671 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting McClain v. Eaton Corp. Disability Plan, 740 F.3d 1059, 1064 (6th Cir. 2014)). It requires us to extend "extreme deference" to Principal Life's decision to deny Card's application for benefits. McClain, 740 F.3d at 1067. "When it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation, based on the evidence, for a particular outcome, that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious." Id. at 1065 (quoting Shields v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, 331 F.3d 536, 541 (6th Cir. 2003)).
ERISA does not "impose a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician's opinion." Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 831, 123 S. Ct. 1965, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1034 (2003). In rejecting the opinion of a treating physician, a plan administrator need only offer "reasons for adopting an alternative opinion" for its decision to survive arbitrary-and-capricious review. Shaw v. AT&T Benefit Plan No. 1, 795 F.3d 538, 549 (6th Cir. 2015). Principal Life rejected the opinions of Card's treating physicians based on the opinions of four specialist physicians, who concluded that the objective medical evidence in Card's file did not support any restrictions on her ability to work. These  physicians noted that Card was diagnosed with CLL with an ECOG performance status of zero. An ECOG performance status of zero indicates a patient is "[f]ully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction." ECOG Performance Status, ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Res. Group, https://ecog-acrin.org/resources/ecog-performance-status (last visited Oct. 23, 2019) (cited in Appellant Br. at 21 n.6). The physicians further concluded that none of Card's subsequent laboratory reports or clinical findings indicated that her CLL had worsened. A "reasonable mind" could therefore conclude, as Principal Life did in its final denial letter, that Card's medical documentation did not support the limitations indicated by her treating physicians. See Dupont Dow Elastomers, LLC v. NLRB, 296 F.3d 495, 500 (6th Cir. 2002) (defining "substantial evidence" under arbitrary-and-capricious review as "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion"). I therefore disagree with the majority that Principal Life rejected the opinions of Card's treating physicians "without explanation."
The majority also makes much of the fact that Principal Life never discussed Card's job requirements in detail, but this is not an absolute requirement for surviving arbitrary-and-capricious review. Under this standard, we examine only whether Principal Life's decision "results from a deliberate principled reasoning process and is supported by substantial evidence." McClain, 740 F.3d at 1064-65 (quoting Schwalm v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 626 F.3d 299, 308 (6th Cir. 2010)). In other words, did Principal Life articulate "a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made"? Hosseini v. Nielsen, 911 F.3d 366, 371 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting GTE Midwest, Inc. v. FCC, 233 F.3d 341, 345 (6th Cir. 2000)). If Principal Life had found that Card's CLL in some way limited her functions, the majority would be right that Principal Life would then have to look to Card's actual duties to see whether she could still perform them. But Principal Life reasonably concluded from the objective medical evidence that Card's condition did not place any limitations on her at all. From this, Principal Life could reasonably infer that Card was not disabled, because however demanding Card's job duties were, her CLL could not have prevented her from performing them. This logical conclusion drawn from premises supported by substantial evidence is all that the arbitrary-and-capricious standard demands of a plan administrator.
Lastly, the majority makes the puzzling claim that it was "problematic" for Principal Life to rely "on only objective evidence from plaintiff's medical records to deny benefits." Under the plan terms, however, Card bears the burden of establishing that she is disabled. We have previously noted that "subjective complaints of fatigue . . . are easy to make, but almost impossible to refute." Yeager v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 88 F.3d 376, 382 (6th Cir. 1996) (internal record citation omitted). I therefore disagree that no reasonable mind could conclude that a claimant has failed to prove she is disabled when the objective medical evidence from her record does not support her subjective claims of fatigue. See id. ("In the absence of any definite anatomic explanation of plaintiff's symptoms, we cannot find that the administrator's decision to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious.").
Principal Life based its denial of Card's claims on four specialist physicians' analyses of the evidence in her medical records. We must apply "extreme deference" to its decision because the plan grants discretion to Principal Life to interpret its terms. McClain, 740 F.3d at 1064. Since I cannot say that it is "[im]possible to offer a reasoned  explanation, based on the evidence, for [this] particular outcome," id. at 1065 (quoting Shields, 331 F.3d at 541), I respectfully dissent. I would AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment to Principal Life.
