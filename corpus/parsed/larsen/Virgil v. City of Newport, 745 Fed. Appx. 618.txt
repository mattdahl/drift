, concurring in the judgment. In Moldowan v. City of Warren, this court held that it was clearly established in August 1990 that police officers had a duty to disclose evidence to the prosecutor when its "exculpatory value" was "apparent."1  578 F.3d 351, 388 (6th Cir. 2009). The question in this case is whether Moldowan's rule was also clearly established two years earlier, in September 1988. In D'Ambrosio v. Marino, this court held that the Moldowan standard is "the functional equivalent of a requirement that the officer act in bad faith." 747 F.3d 378, 390 (6th Cir. 2014) (quotations omitted). On that understanding of the Moldowan test, I concur in the court's judgment that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.
Virgil has alleged that defendants deliberately concealed exculpatory evidence that was material to his case. He alleges, for example, that the officers tried to frame him; that they coerced an inmate to testify falsely that Virgil had confessed to the murder; and that they then deliberately suppressed exculpatory evidence regarding alternative suspects. Such conduct, if proved, would surely amount to bad faith or its functional equivalent; and there can be little question that it was well established before September 1988 that police officers could not deliberately conceal material, exculpatory evidence. See, e.g., Haley v. City of Boston, 657 F.3d 39, 48-51 (1st Cir. 2011) (explaining that "in 1972, it was not clearly established that Brady's no-fault disclosure obligation applied to police officers as opposed to prosecutors," but holding that it was clearly established then that "[d]eliberate concealment of material evidence by the police,  designed to grease the skids for false testimony and encourage wrongful conviction, unarguably implicates a defendant's due process rights."); Porter v. White, 483 F.3d 1294, 1306 (11th Cir. 2007) ("[T]he law was clearly established as of 1987 and 1988 that a police officer had a duty not to intentionally withhold exculpatory evidence from the prosecution."); Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F.2d 985, 995 (7th Cir. 1988) ("[A]ttempts to circumvent the rule of [Brady] by retaining records in clandestine files deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be tolerated." (emphasis added)). Therefore, I concur in the judgment.
