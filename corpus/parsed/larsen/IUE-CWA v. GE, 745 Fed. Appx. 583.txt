, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. The Supreme Court has repeatedly reminded this court to apply ordinary principles of contract interpretation when deciding whether a collective bargaining agreement vests healthcare benefits for life. See M & G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett, 135 S. Ct. 926, 930, 190 L. Ed. 2d 809 (2015); CNH Indus. N.V. v. Reese, 138 S. Ct. 761, 762, 200 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2018) (per curiam). The majority appropriately applies these ordinary principles in Parts 2 and 3 of its Analysis. I, therefore, concur in those parts of the opinion and in the judgment.
