, concurring in the judgment. In the district court, Sheffey lodged a lone objection to the application of the Guidelines' career offender enhancement—that his prior conviction for aggravated robbery in Ohio was not a "crime of violence," and thus could not count as a predicate offense under the Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a) (stating that the "career offender" enhancement applies to a defendant with "at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense"). On appeal, Sheffey concedes that this argument is foreclosed by binding precedent, see United States v. Patterson, 853 F.3d 298 (6th Cir. 2017), and instead raises a new argument—that his prior Ohio conviction for heroin trafficking under Ohio Revised Code § 2925.03(A)(2), is categorically overbroad, and thus cannot count as a predicate "controlled substance offense" under the Guidelines. Because Sheffey's sole challenge on appeal was not presented below, I would review this question for plain error. See United States v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc). Sheffey cannot meet that standard. An error is not "plain" "unless the error is clear under current law." United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993). "A 'circuit split precludes a finding of plain error,'" as does "a lack of binding case law" from our circuit. United States v. Al-Maliki, 787 F.3d 784, 794 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Williams, 53 F.3d 769, 772 (6th Cir. 1995)). Here, as the majority points out, both conditions obtain. For that reason, I agree that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.
