 in part and concurring only in the judgment in part. I agree with my colleagues that the district court properly granted the government's motion for summary judgment as to Bunche's failure-to-document and failure-to-train claims. I cannot agree, however, with the majority's conclusion that Bunche's claim can proceed without an expert. Yet, because the district court granted summary judgment without affording the plaintiff discovery or time to secure an expert, summary judgment was premature.
A Medical Malpractice Claim. Bunche's claim that he received untimely medical treatment is a claim of medical malpractice and the district court was right to characterize it as such. Bunche contends that the nurse, who heard his reported symptoms and his self-diagnosis, should have known that he could not wait until the next day for treatment. I cannot see how the nurse's assessment that treatment could wait until morning is not conduct involving medical judgment. See Andrew v. Begley, 203 S.W.3d 165, 171 (Ky. Ct. App. 2006) (distinguishing a medical malpractice claim from battery by noting that medical malpractice claims depend on professional judgment or surgical skill). The nurse's assessment may have been based on incomplete facts because she did not personally examine Bunche, but that does not take her conduct out of the realm of medical judgment. Accordingly, Bunche's claim is one for medical malpractice. And, under Kentucky law, most medical malpractice claims cannot proceed without an expert. Adams v. Sietsema, 533 S.W.3d 172, 179 (Ky. 2017).
Negligence per se. Although I believe the district court was right to characterize Bunche's claim as one for medical malpractice, Bunche has repeatedly disavowed that characterization. He insists instead that his claim is for negligence per se. The majority accepts this characterization. But understood as negligence per se, Bunche's claim fails as a matter of law. And even if he had stated a claim, he would still need an expert to prove it.
Bunche's claim for negligence per se alleges that the United States is liable for breaching the duty of care outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2). Of course, the "FTCA 'neither creates causes of action against the United States nor provides a means of enforcing federal statutory duties." Premo v. United States, 599 F.3d 540, 544 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Cundiff, 555 F.3d 200, 217 (6th Cir. 2009)). And so, § 4042(a) could only provide the basis for an FTCA suit based on negligence per se if Kentucky law would permit such a suit. Under Kentucky law, however, the violation of a federal statute cannot serve as the basis of a claim of negligence per se. St. Luke Hosp., Inc. v. Straub, 354 S.W.3d 529, 534 (Ky. 2011) (recognizing that Kentucky codified common law negligence per se in Ky. Rev. Stat. § 446.0701  and that "[v]iolations of federal laws and regulations and the laws of other states do not create a cause of action based on KRS 446.070" (footnote omitted)). Accordingly, Bunche cannot proceed on a negligence per se theory under the FTCA. See Chomic v. United States, 377 F.3d 607, 611 (6th Cir. 2004) (Under the FTCA, "[s]tate law determines whether there is an underlying cause of action." (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
But even if Kentucky did recognize negligence per se claims based on the violation of a federal statute, it is unclear how Bunche could prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2) divorced from Kentucky tort law. In Kentucky, as elsewhere, "[n]egligence per se . . . 'is . . . a negligence claim with a statutory [or regulatory] standard of care substituted for the common law standard of care.'" Wright v. House of Imports, Inc., 381 S.W.3d 209, 213 (Ky. 2012) (quoting Real Estate Mktg., Inc. v. Franz, 885 S.W.2d 921, 927, 41 11 Ky. L. Summary 35 (Ky. 1994)). In other words, the "negligence per se rule simply recognizes that negligence is proved by showing the violation of a statute aimed at protecting the plaintiff from the kinds of harms she suffered." Dobbs' Law of Torts § 148. "Statutes governing traffic safety are perhaps the most common statutes for application of the negligence per se rule." Id. (citations omitted). Likewise, a "statute may require a lifeguard at a pool, lights on a ship, buildings constructed to specific requirements, safety devices for protection of construction workers, smoke detectors for the protection of tenants; violation is negligence per se." Id. (collecting cases); see also Real Estate Mktg., Inc., 885 S.W.2d at 927 ("Thus building code violations, if proved, constitute negligence per se . . . .").
18 U.S.C § 4042(a) is a curious candidate on which to base a claim of negligence per se. Quite unlike the safety statutes referenced above, § 4042(a)(2) states merely that the BOP shall "provide for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States . . . ." The statute offers no substantive standards by which to judge whether the BOP has provided the appropriate "care."
The majority relies on our unpublished decision Friedman v. United States, No. 99-1445, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, 2000 WL 876391 (6th Cir. June 21, 2000), for its conclusion that the BOP breached the level of "care" owed. Friedman, in turn, points to United States v. Muniz, in which the Supreme Court stated that "the duty of care owed by the Bureau of Prisons to federal prisoners is fixed by 18 U.S.C. § 4042, independent of an inconsistent state rule." Friedman, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, 2000 WL 876391 at *2 (quoting Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 164-65, 83 S. Ct. 1850, 10 L. Ed. 2d 805 (1963)). Some exploration of Muniz is therefore in order.
In Muniz, the Supreme Court held that, in the FTCA, "Congress ha[d] clearly consented" to suits by federal prisoners. 374 U.S. at 153. For prisoners, as for all FTCA claimants, "[w]hether a claim could be made out would depend upon whether a private individual under like circumstances would be liable under state law." Id.; see also id. at 152 (FTCA recovery depends on whether "'a private person[] would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.'" (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b))). This dependency on state law, however, raised a worry about attempts to "limit suits by federal prisoners because of restrictive state rules of immunity." Id. at 164. "Jailers in some States," the Court noted, "are not liable to their prisoners." Id. In this context, the Court stated that "the duty of care owed by the Bureau of Prisons to federal prisoners is fixed by 18 U.S.C. § 4042, independent of an inconsistent state rule." Id. at 164-65. And so, state immunity law cannot shield federal employees from suit under the FTCA. At the same time, however, the Court confirmed that state law would provide the substantive rules of decision. See id. at 153; see also id. at 162 (noting that, under the FTCA, "[e]ven a matter such as improper medical treatment can be judged under the varying state laws of malpractice without violent dislocation of prison routine" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).
Our court's decision in Friedman clearly understood Muniz this way. After quoting the relevant paragraph from Muniz, we stated:
Based on this language, we conclude that Friedman need not show that Minnesota law allows prisoners to bring negligence claims against prison officials. Indeed, as the [Supreme] Court explained, Congress has provided an independent federal duty of care by directing the Bureau of Prisons to "provide suitable quarters and provide for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States, or held as witnesses or otherwise." 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(2).
Friedman, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15353, 2000 WL 876391, at *3 (footnote omitted). At the same time, we concluded that "[t]o determine whether the government has breached the federal duty of care set by 18 U.S.C. § 4042, we must look to Minnesota's general negligence principles." Id. Though the "duty of care is set by section 4042," "[i]n order to determine liability, the elements of state tort law must be applied." Id. (citations omitted).
Bunche, therefore, cannot escape Kentucky law. His claim for negligence per se fails as a matter of law because Kentucky does not allow federal statutes to provide the basis for such claims. But even if Kentucky would allow § 4042(a) to serve as the basis for a claim of negligence per se, "[i]n order to determine liability, the elements of state tort law must be applied." Id. (citations omitted). And under Kentucky law, Bunche would need an expert.
Expert Witness. Under Kentucky law, Bunche was required to provide expert testimony. The Kentucky Supreme Court has explained that:
[m]ost medical malpractice claims involve issues of science or professional skill outside the ordinary experiences and range of knowledge of typical jurors and judges. For that reason, most, but certainly not all, medical malpractice claims cannot be proven without expert opinion testimony to establish that the conduct in question departed from the applicable standard of care and was a proximate cause of the damages claimed.
Adams, 533 S.W.3d at 179 (citations omitted). Expert testimony is not needed, however, in two kinds of cases: (1) "in res ipsa loquitur cases, where the jury may reasonably infer both negligence and causation from the mere occurrence of the event and the defendant's relation to it," and (2) "in cases where the defendant physician makes certain admissions that make his negligence apparent." Blankenship v. Collier, 302 S.W.3d 665, 670 (Ky. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Bunche invokes the first of these exceptions—res ipsa loquitur. A res ipsa loquitur case is one in which "'any layman is competent to pass judgment and conclude from common experience that such things do not happen if there has been proper skill and care'; illustrated by cases where the surgeon leaves a foreign object in the body or removes or injures an inappropriate part of the anatomy." Perkins v. Hausladen, 828 S.W.2d 652, 655, 39 4 Ky. L. Summary 48 (Ky. 1992) (quoting Prosser and Keeton on Torts, § 39 (5th ed. 1984)). This is not such a case.
Here, Bunche's treatment was delayed by approximately ten hours. Bunche claims the delay was medically negligent and caused him to suffer anxiety, pain, impairment in the function of his left foot and ankle, and kidney damage. Without expert testimony, however, a reasonable layperson could not conclude that Bunche's self-diagnosis of cellulitis, even combined with his self-reported symptoms ("fever, chills, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and pain in left foot"), required immediate medical intervention; nor could a reasonable layperson conclude that Bunche would not have suffered from his alleged injuries even with immediate medical treatment. Applying Kentucky law, our district courts have held that "these kinds of 'delay-based allegations . . . are fundamentally different from a surgeon leaving a foreign object in a person or operating on the wrong part of the body." Gonzalez v. United States, No. 17-270-DLB, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30022, 2018 WL 1050454, *3-4 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 26, 2018) (quoting Earle v. United States, No. 6:13-cv-184, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50374, 2016 WL 8814363, *6 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 8, 2016)); see also Jones v. Gaes, No. 2009-SC-000780-DG, 2011 Ky. Unpub. LEXIS 40, 2011 WL 1642225, at *3 (Ky. Apr. 21, 2011) ("Absent expert testimony, a layperson is not competent to determine whether the alleged delay by Dr. Jones in recognizing and treating Gaes's perforated colon was the proximate cause of her pain and suffering, the colostomy procedure, or her ongoing medical problems."). The district court was right that Bunche needed expert testimony to establish his claim.2 
But even so, summary judgment was prematurely granted in this case. "The general rule is that summary judgment is improper if the non-movant is not afforded a sufficient opportunity for discovery." Vance v. United States, 90 F.3d 1145, 1148 (6th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). Here, Bunche was afforded no opportunity for discovery, despite specifically naming individuals, including his treating physicians, that he believed could serve as expert witnesses. Bunche should have had an opportunity to depose his treating physicians. It is possible that one of his own doctors would testify to the standard of treatment for his condition and to whether, in his expert opinion, that standard was breached in this case. See id. ("[T]he necessary expert testimony may be supplied by the defendant's admissions during discovery, or through medical evidence obtained from other treating physicians." (citing Perkins, 828 S.W.2d at 655-56)).
* * *
I concur in the majority's opinion and judgment affirming the district court's decision to grant summary judgment as to Bunche's failure-to-document and failure-to-train claims. But I disagree with the majority's conclusion that Bunche's claim for delayed medical treatment can proceed without an expert. Yet, because the district court granted summary judgment without affording the plaintiff discovery or time to secure an expert, summary judgment was improper at this time. Accordingly, I respectfully concur only in the judgment with respect to this claim.
