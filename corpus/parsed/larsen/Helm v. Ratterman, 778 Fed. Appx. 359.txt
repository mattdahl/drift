, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I join the majority in affirming the district court's dismissal of Helm's § 1983 claims as untimely. The majority also appropriately concludes that Helm has failed to establish a fiduciary relationship, one of four ways in which a plaintiff may show a duty to disclose under Kentucky law. See Giddings & Lewis, Inc. v. Indus. Risk Insurers, 348 S.W.3d 729, 747-48 (Ky. 2011).
Though Helm has not established a duty to disclose, an essential element of a fraud-by-omission claim, the majority nevertheless addresses the district court's ruling on another element of that claim—inducement to act. I would not reach that question. That issue presents an unsettled question of state law: whether Kentucky law recognizes a fraud-by-omission claim where the plaintiff contends that he or she was induced to refrain from acting. There is no reason for us to address that question now. Our resolution of the unsettled state law question may have no effect on the outcome; the district court may determine on remand that Helm cannot establish a duty to disclose, in which case his claim would fail. For these reasons, I would refrain from addressing the unsettled question of state law until a time when, if ever, it is squarely before us. See Combs v. Int'l Ins. Co., 354 F.3d 568, 577 (6th Cir. 2004) (recognizing "that federal courts must proceed with caution when making pronouncements about state law" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Instead, I would vacate the district court's judgment regarding Helm's fraud-by-omission claim and remand for it to address first whether Helm has pleaded a duty to disclose. I, therefore, join all but Part II.B.2 of the majority opinion.
