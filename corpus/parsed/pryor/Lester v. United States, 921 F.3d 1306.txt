, respecting the denial of rehearing en banc:
A majority of the Court has voted not to rehear this appeal en banc to reconsider whether a subset of federal prisoners classified as career offenders under the United States Sentencing Guidelines can seek resentencing on collateral review based on the void-for-vagueness doctrine explicated in Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 192 L. Ed. 2d 569 (2015), which invalidated the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act. As background, we held in United States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir. 2015), and the Supreme Court later confirmed in Beckles v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 886, 197 L. Ed. 2d 145 (2017), that prisoners who were sentenced as career offenders after the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), cannot benefit from Johnson because—at least after Booker—the void-for-vagueness doctrine does not apply to the Sentencing Guidelines. But neither Matchett nor Beckles resolved whether those sentenced as career offenders before Booker can collaterally attack their sentences.
Our published order In re Griffin, 823 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir. 2016), answered that question in the negative for two independent reasons. First, Griffin applied the reasoning of Matchett to hold that the Guidelines are not susceptible to void-for-vagueness challenges no matter whether a prisoner was sentenced before or after Booker. See id. at 1354-55. Second, although the Supreme Court has held that the new legal rule of Johnson applies retroactively to cases on collateral review because it is "substantive," see Welch v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 194 L. Ed. 2d 387 (2016), Griffin held that an analogous new rule applying the void-for-vagueness doctrine to pre-Booker career-offender sentences under the Guidelines would be not be substantive and, as a result, could not be applied retroactively. See 823 F.3d at 1355-56.
Griffin and Matchett speak for themselves as to the first holding, but I write in response to Judge Martin's statement respecting the denial of rehearing en banc to explain that Griffin's second holding must be correct. In brief, Johnson was a substantive decision that entitled prisoners sentenced under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act to relief because it made clear that the law had never authorized their convictions and sentences. By contrast, a new rule extending Johnson to set aside pre-Booker career-offender sentences—all of which fall within the substantive statutory ranges prescribed by  Congress—would require only the procedural formality of a resentencing in which the district court would have the power to impose exactly the same sentence as before. Such a rule, as we concluded in Griffin, would not be substantive. See id. at 1355-56. To my mind, this nutshell summary of Griffin's second holding says all that needs to be said. But, because some of my colleagues see the matter differently, this statement explains at greater length why a new rule extending Johnson's void-for-vagueness holding to invalidate pre-Booker career-offender sentences would not be substantive.
I divide my discussion in three parts. First, I explain that the rationale underlying the retroactivity of substantive rules is that courts lack the authority to enter a judgment of conviction or impose a sentence the substance of which the law does not authorize, and I explain that the new rule that Judge Martin's statement advocates would not be substantive in this sense because the sentences it would invalidate were imposed within the statutory ranges established by Congress. Second, I explain that Judge Martin's counterargument cannot be squared with Booker. Third, I respond briefly to Judge Rosenbaum's statement.
 A. The Retroactivity of Substantive Rules.
In Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1989), the Supreme Court "adopt[ed] [the] approach to retroactivity for cases on collateral review" that the second Justice Harlan had developed in two influential opinions. Id. at 292; Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 675-702, 91 S. Ct. 1160, 28 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in the judgment); Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 256-69, 89 S. Ct. 1030, 22 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Under this familiar framework, "new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced." Teague, 489 U.S. at 310 (O'Connor, J., plurality opinion). Although the Court has maintained that there exists an exception for "a small set of 'watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding,'" it has also stressed that this exception is "extremely narrow," and it has never held that any rule falls within the exception. Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 352, 124 S. Ct. 2519, 159 L. Ed. 2d 442 (2004) (some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 495, 110 S. Ct. 1257, 108 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1990)).
In contrast to new procedural rules, "[n]ew substantive rules generally apply retroactively." Id. at 351. This category "includes decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms, as well as constitutional determinations that place particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the State's power to punish." Id. at 351-52 (citation omitted). It also includes "rules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense." Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 330, 109 S. Ct. 2934, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1989), overruled on other grounds by Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002).
Although it is common for courts to "refer[] to rules of this . . . type as falling under an exception to Teague's bar on retroactive application of procedural rules," "they are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subject to the bar." Schriro, 542 U.S. at 352 n.4. After all, "Teague by its terms  applies only to procedural rules." Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 620, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 140 L. Ed. 2d 828 (1998). To be sure, there is no practical difference between a rule that falls within "an exception to Teague's bar" and a rule "not subject to the bar." Schriro, 542 U.S. at 352 n.4. But the doctrinal basis of the retroactivity of substantive rules is independent of Teague and indeed long predates it.
More than a century before Teague, the Supreme Court held that prisoners could use the writ of habeas corpus to challenge the substantive validity of their convictions and sentences. Traditionally, of course, the writ was unavailable to challenge mere error by the sentencing court. The habeas jurisdiction of the federal courts was subject to "limitations . . . arising from the nature and objects of the writ itself, as defined by the common law." Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 375, 25 L. Ed. 717 (1879). And "the general rule [was] that a conviction and sentence by a court of competent jurisdiction [was] lawful cause of imprisonment," from which "no relief [could] be given by habeas corpus." Id. "The only ground" for relief "to a prisoner under conviction and sentence of another court [was] the want of jurisdiction in such court over the person or the cause, or some other matter rendering its proceedings void." Id.
In Siebold, the best known of a number of late-nineteenth-century decisions with similar rationales, the Court held that a prisoner's argument that his statute of conviction was unconstitutional did not exceed the limited scope of the writ. The Court reasoned that an unconstitutional statute "affects the foundations of the whole proceedings." Id. at 376. After all, "[a]n unconstitutional law is void, and is as no law." Id. So, the Court deduced, "[a] conviction under it is not merely erroneous, but is illegal and void." Id. And because the trial court's "authority to indict and try the petitioners arose solely upon the[] laws" they challenged, "if the laws [were] unconstitutional," it followed that "the [trial court] acquired no jurisdiction of the causes." Id. at 377. In other decisions, the Court employed the same jurisdictional logic to hold that habeas corpus was available to correct a sentence imposed without legal authority. See, e.g., In re Bonner, 151 U.S. 242, 255, 14 S. Ct. 323, 38 L. Ed. 149 (1894); In re Mills, 135 U.S. 263, 270, 10 S. Ct. 762, 34 L. Ed. 107 (1890); Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 176, 21 L. Ed. 872 (1873). The Court treated each of these cases "not [as] a case of mere error, but [as] one in which the court below transcended its powers"—that is, exceeded its jurisdiction. Mills, 135 U.S. at 270.
To be sure, the Court's reasoning in Siebold and in related decisions has had its doubters. Some jurists have argued that these decisions expanded the traditional concept of jurisdiction, see, e.g., Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 285, 112 S. Ct. 2482, 120 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1992) (opinion of Thomas, J.); Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 450-51, 454-55, 83 S. Ct. 822, 9 L. Ed. 2d 837 (1963) (Harlan, J., dissenting), maybe even to the point of unintelligibility, see Paul M. Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 470-71 & n.66 (1963). And Supreme Court justices have disagreed about how to interpret Siebold and about how far its logic extends. Compare Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718, 730-32, 193 L. Ed. 2d 599 (2016), with id. at 740-41 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and id. at 748 (Thomas, J., dissenting).
But whatever doubt there may be about the reasoning in Siebold and similar decisions, there should be no doubt that, as a historical matter, it supplied the rationale  for what we now know as the substantive "exception." When Justice Harlan explained that courts should not bar the retroactive application of new rules "that place . . . certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe," he added—with specific reference to Siebold and kindred decisions—that "the writ has historically been available for attacking convictions on such grounds." Mackey, 401 U.S. at 692-93 & n.8 (Harlan, J., concurring in the judgment); see also Desist, 394 U.S. at 261 n.2 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (discussing Siebold's jurisdictional rationale); Fay, 372 U.S. at 454-55 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (same). As the Court started to embrace Justice Harlan's retroactivity framework in decisions leading up to Teague, it too connected retroactivity with the sentencing court's lack of jurisdiction. See United States v. Johnson, 457 U.S. 537, 550, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1982) ("recogniz[ing] [that] full retroactivity [is] a necessary adjunct to a ruling that a trial court lacked authority to convict or punish a criminal defendant in the first place," making its "judgments or sentences . . . void ab initio"); see also Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 324, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1987) (paraphrasing Johnson as having explained that retroactivity attaches "when the new ruling was that a trial court lacked authority to convict a criminal defendant in the first place").
Nor can there be any doubt that the substantive exception continues to rest on this jurisdictional rationale. In Montgomery v. Louisiana, the Court explained that "[b]y holding that new substantive rules are . . . retroactive, Teague continued a long tradition." 136 S. Ct. at 730. The Montgomery Court illustrated that "tradition" with a detailed discussion of Siebold, which, it explained, had "addressed why substantive rules must have retroactive effect." Id. The Court explained that "the same logic"—that is, Siebold's jurisdictional rationale—"governs a challenge to a punishment" that the states lack "authority to impose." Id. at 731. Montgomery reaffirmed Siebold's rule that "[a] conviction or sentence imposed in violation of a substantive rule is not just erroneous but contrary to law and, as a result, void." Id. And, the Court reasoned, "[i]t follows . . . that a court has no authority to leave in place a conviction or sentence that violates a substantive rule, regardless of [when] the conviction or sentence became final." Id. The Court's explanation in Welch of why Johnson is substantive—that because the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act "is invalid," it cannot "mandate or authorize any sentence," 136 S. Ct. at 1265—also would have been at home in any of the decisions in the Siebold family. Cf., e.g., Mills, 135 U.S. at 270 ("The court below was without jurisdiction to pass any such sentences . . . .").
The doctrinal pedigree and rationale of the substantive exception logically dictate its scope. The exception is based on the idea that a court has no authority to enter a judgment of conviction under a void statute or to impose a sentence not authorized by law. Necessarily, then, when a prisoner's conviction is supported by a valid statute and his sentence is authorized by law, the substantive exception cannot apply. Cf. Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 373, 113 S. Ct. 838, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1993) ("Cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex.").
From this understanding of the substantive exception, it follows that the exception does not apply to pre-Booker sentences under the Guidelines. Every sentence that has ever been imposed under the Guidelines—either before or after Booker—falls within the statutory range of punishment  prescribed by Congress for the defendant's offense. See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 374-75, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989) (explaining that when Congress empowered the Sentencing Commission to promulgate the Guidelines, it "instructed the Commission that these sentencing ranges must be consistent with pertinent provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code and could not include sentences in excess of the statutory maxima"). And every court that has ever imposed a sentence under the Guidelines had the authority to impose a sentence within the statutory range.
Take Stoney Lester as an example. Lester pleaded guilty in 2003 to distributing more than five grams of crack cocaine, an offense with a statutory range of five to 40 years of imprisonment. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(iii). The sentence he received under the Guidelines—21 years and 10 months—was squarely within the statutory range and, as such, within the authority granted to the district court by Congress. So even if the career-offender provision that was used to calculate Lester's sentence under the Guidelines were somehow unconstitutionally vague, the substantive exception would not extend to Lester's sentence.
To look at the same idea from a different angle, consider the result if Lester or a similarly situated prisoner prevailed in a vagueness attack on the career-offender sentencing Guideline. A successful vagueness challenge would establish only that the district court improperly relied on an unacceptably unclear directive in arriving at the prisoner's sentence. But it would not in the slightest establish that the district court lacked the authority to impose the substantive sentence at which it arrived. On the contrary, as Griffin observed, the district court could impose exactly the same sentence on remand after the appellate court corrected its error. 823 F.3d at 1355. In this respect, erroneous reliance on an unconstitutionally vague sentencing Guideline, if such a thing were to exist, resembles "procedural" sentencing errors—errors like "failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, . . . or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence," Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007)—for which the remedy is a remand with corrective instructions but with no guarantee of a different outcome. And, as we explained in Griffin and as the Solicitor General argued in Beckles, this fact means that a new rule extending Johnson to the career-offender sentencing Guideline would also be "procedural," not substantive, for purposes of retroactivity. See Griffin, 823 F.3d at 1355-56; Brief for the United States at 11-33, Beckles v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 886, 197 L. Ed. 2d 145 (No. 15-8544).
 B. The "Mandatory Guidelines" and Booker.
Judge Martin's statement responds that this reasoning "fundamentally misunderstands how the mandatory Guidelines worked" because it ignores that, before Booker, "the shortest sentence the District Court was legally allowed to give [Lester]" "[o]nce categorized as a career-offender" was greater than "the longest sentence he could have received if not deemed a career offender." Statement of Martin, J., at 48. The argument is not expressly framed in terms of whether the district court had the substantive authority to impose Lester's sentence, but to translate it into those terms is easy enough. In this view, it does not matter to retroactivity that the district court could sentence a pre-Booker career offender like Lester to the same term of imprisonment today. See id. at 49. Instead, the critical point is that—without the career-offender  provision—it lacked the substantive authority to impose the sentence then, in the pre-Booker era when the Guidelines dictated what sentences were "legally allowed." Id. at 48; see also id. at 38-40.
This response contains an important internal tension. In Judge Martin's account, the putative unconstitutionality of the career-offender Guideline, which her statement contends was established by the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Johnson, must "relate back" to the time of Lester's sentencing in 2003; otherwise, there would be no ground to argue that Lester's sentence was substantively invalid. But the advisory nature of the Guidelines, which was established by the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Booker, must not relate back to Lester's sentencing. If Booker's construction of the Guidelines' legal status was the correct view of the law at the time of Lester's sentencing, then the "mandatory Guidelines" did not exist in a legal sense, did not limit the district court's discretion to choose an appropriate sentence within the statutory range, and did not render his actual sentence substantively invalid.
The premise that the Sentencing Guidelines were in the strictest sense legally binding before Booker pervades Judge Martin's statement. As her statement puts it, "[u]nder the mandatory Guidelines, federal district courts were bound by law to impose sentences within the guideline range." Id. at 38. Her statement explains, "the mandatory Guidelines were laws that increased punishment"—laws that, "[i]n effect, . . . set minimum and maximum sentences." Id. at 40, 48. And it insists that the Guidelines, "[b]y law," dictated the sentences that the district court "was legally allowed to give" Lester. Id. at 48. In this view, "the sentencing judge had no legal authority to sentence [Lester] to other than a sentence mandated by the Guidelines then in effect." Id. at 38-39.
This manner of speaking, of course, is by no means peculiar to Judge Martin. Virtually all of us are in the habit of distinguishing, in one way or another, between the "mandatory Guidelines" that operated before Booker and the "advisory Guidelines" that have operated since. See, e.g., Matchett, 802 F.3d at 1196 (referring to "when the guidelines were still mandatory"); United States v. Martin, 455 F.3d 1227, 1236 (11th Cir. 2006) ("As we all now know, Booker made the guidelines advisory.").
Purely as a description of judicial doctrine and practice, this language makes sense. Cf. Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 457-61 (1897). Before Booker, district courts believed they were bound to apply the Guidelines as mandatory, and the courts of appeals would reverse district courts that treated them as merely advisory. After Booker, district courts recognized that they were bound not to apply the Guidelines as mandatory, and the courts of appeals will now reverse district courts that fail to treat them as advisory. This change in court behavior makes it natural to say that Booker "made the Guidelines advisory."
But even if our idioms adequately describe judicial practice, they may be erroneous or inadequate in other respects. And we must be careful not to let the imprecision of our language control our reasoning. "[W]ords are wise men's counters, they do but reckon by them; but they are the money of fools." Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan 19 (Edwin Curley ed., Hackett 1994 [1651]).
In particular, we should be mindful of the difference between a change in judicial doctrine and a change in law. This distinction,  although sometimes easy to overlook, is fundamental. Without distinguishing between judges' understanding of the law and the law itself, we could not meaningfully say, for example, that a change in judicial doctrine "proved Mr. Lester's objection right and Eleventh Circuit case law wrong," Statement of Martin, J., at 33, nor could the Supreme Court meaningfully describe a past decision of its own as "wrong the day it was decided," Planned Parenthood of Se. Penn. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 863, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992) (joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.); see also Stephen E. Sachs, Finding Law, 107 Calif. L. Rev. (forthcoming Apr. 2019) (manuscript at 43) (available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3064443 (last visited Apr. 28, 2019)). And we would be hard-pressed to explain why Johnson required the retroactive invalidation of final convictions and sentences based on the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act, see Welch, 136 S. Ct. at 1265, when an act of Congress that merely repealed the clause would not do so. The answer, of course, is that Johnson did not strictly speaking change the law; "rather, it held and therefore established that the prior decisions [treating the residual clause as valid] were incorrect." Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 312, 114 S. Ct. 1510, 128 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1994); see also Harper v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 97, 113 S. Ct. 2510, 125 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1993). In the light of Johnson, the residual clause was, as a matter of law, always invalid.
So it can be misleading to say, as we often do, that "the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory," Statement of Martin, J., at 31, and that the Supreme Court "made" them advisory in Booker. These idioms suggest that the Guidelines were once really mandatory as a matter of law and that they became advisory as a matter of law only after—and only because of—Booker. But that cannot be right. If Booker's effect was to change the essential legal status of the Guidelines from mandatory to advisory, then it must have been one of two things: either a legislative amendment that removed the textual command that courts apply the Guidelines as mandatory, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), from the Sentencing Reform Act and replaced it with a provision that the Guidelines be treated as advisory or, alternatively, a constitutional amendment that newly prohibited the mandatory application of the Guidelines. But Booker—a judicial decision—was neither of those things.
The Supreme Court wields judicial power, not legislative power. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 1; id. art. III, § 1. It has no power to amend the text or meaning of any statute; it has the authority only "to say what a statute means," which means "what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction," in the course of deciding a case or controversy. Rivers, 511 U.S. at 312-13. Nor does the Supreme Court have the authority to amend the Constitution. See, e.g., Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 288, 84 S. Ct. 1814, 12 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1964) (In constitutional cases, the Court's "duty is to construe, not to rewrite or amend, the Constitution." (internal quotation marks omitted)); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437, 448, 26 S. Ct. 110, 50 L. Ed. 261, 41 Ct. Cl. 503, T.D. 961 (1905) ("The Constitution is a written instrument. As such its meaning does not alter. That which it meant when adopted, it means now."). So, instead of a legislative act or constitutional amendment that changed the law, Booker was a judicial decision that held that the statutory requirement that courts apply the Guidelines as mandatory is without legal effect.
 Booker established that the Guidelines are not mandatory through two holdings. First, the Court held that the statutory requirement of mandatory application of the Guidelines would violate the Sixth Amendment as applied whenever it resulted in a sentence greater than the maximum sentence that could be imposed based only on the facts reflected in a jury's guilty verdict or admitted by the defendant. See Booker, 543 U.S. at 233-37 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). Second, as a matter of severability, the Court held that the Guidelines could not be applied as mandatory in any cases, even when their mandatory application would not violate the Sixth Amendment, because the resulting system would be structurally unsound and contrary to the intent of Congress. See id. at 249-59, 265-67 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).
Although Booker radically changed judicial doctrine with respect to the Guidelines, neither of its holdings was the equivalent of a legislative or constitutional amendment to the substance of the law. As far as the constitutional holding is concerned, this point should be obvious: "Constitutional invalidity of federal statutes . . . is produced by the Constitution itself, not by the order of a court." John Harrison, Severability, Remedies, and Constitutional Adjudication, 83 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 56, 87 (2014); see also Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177-78, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803). The Sixth Amendment did not mean one thing the day before Booker and another thing the day Booker was decided. The Court in Booker did not make the statutory provision requiring the mandatory application of the Guidelines unconstitutional. Instead, the Court recognized that the provision was unconstitutional by determining the meaning of the Sixth Amendment—that is, by interpreting it—and that its meaning was incompatible with that of the statutory provision in certain circumstances. In those applications, the statutory provision was always unconstitutional; it was always "void, and . . . as no law." Siebold, 100 U.S. at 376; accord Marbury, 5 U.S. at 177.
Booker's severability conclusion is no different. As the Supreme Court and commentators have long acknowledged, severability is fundamentally "an exercise in statutory interpretation." Murphy v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1486, 200 L. Ed. 2d 854 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring); see also, e.g., Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U.S. 286, 290, 44 S. Ct. 323, 68 L. Ed. 686 (1924) (Severability is "a question of interpretation and of legislative intent."); Michael C. Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 289 (1994) ("Severability presents a question of statutory interpretation . . . ."). Specifically, issues of severability pose the interpretive question of how to understand a legal text as a whole in the light of a newly acknowledged fact—that part of the text cannot be given legal effect. See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1486 (Thomas, J., concurring) ("[T]he severability doctrine has courts decide how a statute operates once they conclude that part of it cannot be constitutionally enforced."); Harrison, supra, 83 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. at 88; see also Booker, 543 U.S. at 247 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court) (observing that "severability questions . . . can arise when a legislatively unforeseen constitutional problem requires modification of a statutory provision as applied in a significant number of instances"); id. at 265 ("[W]e have examined the statute in depth to determine Congress' likely intent in light of today's holding."); Dorchy, 264 U.S. at 290 (posing the question whether one section of a state statute was "so interwoven with the [other sections]  held invalid that the section cannot stand alone"). It is because severability issues are interpretive questions that courts answer them by using the same kinds of tools that are applied to other issues of statutory construction, see, e.g., Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 687, 107 S. Ct. 1476, 94 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1987) (finding "abundant indication of a clear congressional intent of severability both in the language and structure of the Act and in its legislative history"), and that they produce the same kinds of disagreements about interpretive methods as do other interpretive problems, see, e.g., Booker, 543 U.S. at 313 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part) ("disagree[ing] with [Justice Stevens's] restatement of severability principles and reliance on legislative history").
The interpretive character of severability holdings—Booker's included—also means that they cannot be understood as if they changed the law in the manner of a legislative amendment. As Justice Scalia once observed, even if it sometimes right to say that "judges in a real sense 'make' law," we must not forget that "they make it as judges make it, which is to say as though they were 'finding' it—discerning what the law is, rather than decreeing what it is today changed to, or what it will tomorrow be." James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U.S. 529, 549, 111 S. Ct. 2439, 115 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). No less than a decision in any other interpretive context, a judicial construction of the Sentencing Reform Act in the light of its conflict with the Sixth Amendment—a conflict that always existed, even if the Court did not formally acknowledge it until Booker—"is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction." Rivers, 511 U.S. at 312-13. Were it otherwise, Booker and other severability decisions would "entail quintessentially legislative work," which is exactly what the Supreme Court has said they do not entail. Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320, 329, 126 S. Ct. 961, 163 L. Ed. 2d 812 (2006); accord Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292, 2319, 195 L. Ed. 2d 665 (2016).
So, our usual figures of speech notwithstanding, it follows from the holdings in Booker that the Guidelines were never really mandatory—not as a matter of law. To be sure, an act of Congress instructed that the sentencing court "shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range," defined in the Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), and district courts thought that this mandatory instruction was legally binding. The courts of appeals thought so too. But, if Booker is right, we were all wrong. The law—not judges' understanding of the law, but the actual law—was otherwise. The Sixth Amendment forbade the mandatory application of the Guidelines whenever they prescribed a sentence greater than the law allowed based only on the facts reflected in a guilty verdict or plea. And, as interpreted by Booker in the light of that constitutional prohibition, the Sentencing Reform Act did not prescribe the mandatory application of the Guidelines in any other circumstances either.
The district court did err when it sentenced Lester, but the error was not imposing an illegal sentence under a mandatory, but unconstitutionally vague, sentencing Guideline. Instead, its error—an error that also happened to be shared by every other district court at the time—was treating the career-offender Guideline as mandatory in the first place. To be sure, that was an error of "constitutional significance," as  Booker confirmed. Statement of Martin, J., at 49. But it was a procedural constitutional error, not a substantive one. See Varela v. United States, 400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding "that Booker's constitutional rule falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively"). And, although Judge Martin's statement suggests that my acknowledgment of that error should convince me to "agree to fix the sentences mistakenly imposed as mandatory," the whole point of Teague is that merely procedural "mistake[s]" do not warrant the extraordinary "fix" of collateral relief. Statement of Martin, J., at 39.
That job is reserved for substantive rules, and, in the light of Booker, Johnson cannot possibly have established that the district court lacked the substantive authority to impose Lester's sentence. If the sentencing court had known what Booker later clarified to be the correct understanding of the law, it would not have recognized that, "[b]y law, the longest sentence [Lester] could . . . receive[] . . . was 151 months." Id. at 48 (emphasis omitted). Instead, Johnson or no Johnson, it would have recognized that it was "legally allowed," id., to impose any sentence within the statutory range of five to 40 years—just as it could if it sentenced Lester today.
Of course, we do not know what sentence Lester would have received if the district court had been aware of what Booker later held. But all we need to know is whether his sentence was within the substantive authority of the district court at the time it was imposed. And it clearly was. So Griffin was absolutely right to hold that a new rule extending Johnson to set aside pre-Booker sentences based on the career-offender Guideline would not be substantive and would not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.
 C. Judge Rosenbaum's Statement.
Judge Rosenbaum's statement responds to my argument in three parts. The first and second parts fail to engage with my argument. And the third part propounds a doctrine of judicial lawmaking that contradicts Marbury's rationale for judicial review.
The first part of Judge Rosenbaum's statement quarrels with my account of the substantive exception. I am not sure Judge Rosenbaum's belief that the exception concerns equally ultra vires action by any branch, not just the judiciary, can be squared with basic habeas principles or with the precedents—all of which stress the sentencing "court['s] lack[] [of] power to exact a penalty that has not been authorized by any valid criminal statute," Welch, 136 S. Ct. at 1268; accord Siebold, 100 U.S. at 377 ("We think [habeas lies], because, if the laws are unconstitutional and void, the Circuit Court acquired no jurisdiction of the causes." (emphases added)), or the habeas court's lack of "authority to leave in place a conviction or sentence that violates a substantive rule," Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 731—but I also doubt that it matters. After all, my argument is that Lester's sentencing court did not exceed its powers because the statutory provision that purported to limit its sentencing discretion was unconstitutional and therefore void. Far from "gloss[ing] over th[e] constitutionally significant problem" of the mandatory application of the Guidelines, Statement of Rosenbaum, J., at 55, I argue that Booker's holding that their mandatory application was unconstitutional controls the question we are discussing. And it establishes that the only rule the district court violated when it sentenced Lester was procedural, not substantive.
 The second part of Judge Rosenbaum's statement identifies the heart of my argument, but it offers no meaningful response. I have said that statements like "Booker made the Guidelines advisory" are ubiquitous but not precisely accurate. Judge Rosenbaum's statement responds only by confirming that they are ubiquitous but makes no effort to refute my point that they are imprecise. See id. at 58-60. I have said that courts used to treat the Guidelines as mandatory but that, as Booker held, they committed legal error by doing so. Judge Rosenbaum's statement responds only by insisting that courts used to treat the Guidelines as mandatory. See id. at 60. Her statement's flotilla of quotations from the United States Reports, see id. at 58-59, ignores, first, that Booker held that the literal sense of those statements is false and, second, that courts routinely describe the terms and intended effects of statutes as if they were valid even as they hold the opposite. See, e.g., Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1483 (stating that the unconstitutional Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act "banned the authorization of sports gambling in casinos" and "prohibited the spread of state-run lotteries"); Marbury, 5 U.S. at 176 ("The authority . . . given to the supreme court . . . appears not to be warranted by the [C]onstitution . . . ." (emphasis added)). The second part's only direct response to my argument—that "the Booker Court did not make the Guidelines advisory because they were always advisory, since the Sixth Amendment never allowed them to be mandatory"—is that it "is certainly interesting on a metaphysical level." Statement of Rosenbaum, J., at 60. I appreciate the compliment.
Only the third part of Judge Rosenbaum's statement is responsive, but unfortunately it fumbles the basic tenets—one might even say the metaphysics—of judicial review. Before Booker, it tells us, "18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) was the law of the land." Id. at 61. Wrong. As Chief Justice Marshall explained in Marbury, "[t]he question, whether an act, repugnant to the [C]onstitution, can become the law of the land" is to be answered resoundingly in the negative. Marbury, 5 U.S. at 176; see also U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2 ("This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States . . . in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . ." (emphasis added)); Mackey, 401 U.S. at 678 (Harlan, J., concurring in the judgment) (observing that Marbury provides "from that day to this the sole continuing rationale for the exercise of" judicial review).
Judge Rosenbaum's statement continues: "[T]he Court's change effectively excised the Guidelines' mandatory language from the United States Code." Statement of Rosenbaum, J., at 62. The word "effectively" bears the whole weight of this sentence. Section 3553(b)(1)'s mandatory language is still there in the Code. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1); see also generally Jonathan F. Mitchell, The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy, 104 Va. L. Rev. 933 (2018). The only thing that has changed is that now, thanks to Booker, we know that it is legally inoperative because the Sixth Amendment—adopted in 1791—requires and has always required that result.
It follows that the correct application of the Guidelines has always been advisory—even for offenders, like Stoney Lester, convicted before Booker. And it follows from that that the substantive exception would not apply to a new rule extending Johnson to set aside Lester's sentence and others like it. Understanding the law on this point requires no familiarity with "the laws of physics" or "the space-time continuum." Statement of Rosenbaum, J., at 60. It instead requires only the humility that comes with appreciating the modest role  that the federal judiciary performs in our constitutional system: "to say what the law is," not what it should be. Marbury, 5 U.S. at 177.
