Hassan Farah has an extensive criminal history that includes multiple convictions for driving while intoxicated, assault, drug possession, and disorderly conduct. The Department of Homeland Security sought to remove him because of these convictions, an immigration judge found that Farah was subject to removal, and the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed. The Board concluded that Farah was subject to removal because his conviction for second-degree assault, Minn. Stat. § 609.222, was a crime of violence and thus an aggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board also decided that Farah's conviction for marijuana possession, Minn. Stat. § 152.025, qualified as a controlled-substance conviction under federal law, which independently made him deportable. See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). It then rejected Farah's applications for asylum and withholding of removal. A panel of this Court denied his motion for a stay of removal and set a briefing schedule.
Our denial should have ended any dispute until the parties litigated the merits. But Farah later filed, without explanation, a "second motion for stay of removal" that rehashed the arguments he raised in his original motion. This Court now reverses course without explanation and gives Farah relief on the exact arguments that we have already rejected.
The decision of the majority ignores the procedural problems that plague Farah's motion. To start, it is untimely. This Court requires litigants to file a motion for reconsideration within 21 days of the entry of the original order. See 11th Cir. R. 27-2. This Court first denied Farah's motion for a stay of removal on July 30, 2016. Farah's second motion for a stay of removal came on November 23, 2019, well beyond this deadline. Farah's arguments also are not appropriate for a motion to reconsider because they repackage the exact issues this Court has already rejected. More is required for relief. See Richardson v. Johnson, 598 F.3d 734, 740 (11th Cir. 2010) ("A motion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).
Even setting these fatal defects aside, the decision of the prior panel was correct. None of Farah's arguments create the necessary "strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits." Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 173 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). First, he contends that his notice to appear for his removal proceedings was defective because it did not include the time of his hearing. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(G)(i). But we have held that the failure to meet this requirement is not jurisdictional, Perez-Sanchez v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 935 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (11th Cir. 2019), and Farah does not explain how a defect in his initial notice to appear changes the outcome of his appeal, particularly when he later received a new notice that did contain the missing information. Farah's challenges to the Board's conclusion that he is removable for committing an aggravated felony and controlled-substance offense fare no better. For the aggravated felony, Farah contends that the statute used to convict him of assault, Minn. Stat. § 609.222, is overbroad. But he does not address the Board's reliance on United States v. Lindsey, which held that section 609.222 inherently requires the "use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another." 827 F.3d 733, 740 (8th Cir. 2016). For the controlled substance offense, Farah argues that the statute used to convict him of marijuana possession does not require the identification of a specific drug as a necessary element, but he fails to mention that the Minnesota Supreme Court has reached the exact opposite conclusion. See State v. Vail, 274 N.W.2d 127, 134 (Minn. 1979) ("Minnesota law requires proof of the actual identity of the substance."). Next, Farah's argument that the Board erred in its denial of his application for withholding of removal would require us to reweigh the evidence that the Board considered, which we cannot do. See Arboleda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 434 F.3d 1220, 1222 (11th Cir. 2006). Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Farah's challenge to the Board's denial of his application for a waiver of inadmissibility because he does not challenge the Board's legal standards. See Makir-Marwil v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 681 F.3d 1227, 1234 n.4 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that this Court "lacks jurisdiction to review . . . the discretionary denial of an application for a waiver of inadmissibility" except for "challenges to the IJ's and BIA's legal standards").
The majority's decision is nothing short of an open invitation for litigants to file successive motions in the hopes of receiving a favorable decision from a different panel. I cannot agree with that result. Farah's motion is untimely, fails to meet our standards for reconsidering our decisions, and fails on the merits.
I dissent.
