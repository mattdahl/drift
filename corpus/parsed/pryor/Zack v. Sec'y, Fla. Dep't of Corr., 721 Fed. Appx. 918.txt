I concur in the panel opinion except that I do not join the gratuitous statement that there is something "very troubling" about "[t]he state's late appointment of collateral counsel." Majority Op. at 16. We lack the power and expertise to manage state post-conviction review, the delay is irrelevant to a motion under Rule 60(b), and I do not share my colleagues' concern that "the process" has failed Zack. Majority Op. at 16 n.1 (emphasis omitted).
The panel opinion points out that "Florida appears not to have complied with its own rules," Majority Op. at 16 n.1, but we should not comment on the delay. How a state exercises its "sovereign power to punish offenders," Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 748, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991) (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 128, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1982)), within the bounds of  the Constitution is the business of the state. And states have no obligation to provide collateral counsel "[b]ecause a prisoner does not have a constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings." Davila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2062, 198 L. Ed. 2d 603 (2017). Nor can we "instruct[] state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law." Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984). And states may have understandable reasons for delays in appointing counsel that are not immediately apparent on federal review: a prisoner might initially refuse further review or counsel, or scheduling, funding, or conflict-of-interest problems might slow appointment. See, e.g., Lugo v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 750 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir. 2014) (pointing out that the petitioner's original counsel "withdrew from . . . representation . . . because it was representing [the petitioner's] codefendant" and that the replacement post-conviction counsel "had a personal conflict of interest . . . [and] asked to be permitted to withdraw"). The panel opinion fails to examine the cause of the delay, but concludes that it is inherently troubling. Federal courts tasked with resolving narrow constitutional questions in habeas proceedings should not concern themselves with plenary review of state processes.
The delay is also irrelevant to this appeal because an alleged defect in a state proceeding cannot support a motion under Rule 60(b). The panel opinion correctly acknowledges that a motion under Rule 60(b) attacks only a "defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings." Lugo, 750 F.3d at 1210 n.11 (emphasis added) (quoting Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S. Ct. 2641, 162 L. Ed. 2d 480 & n.4 (2005)). And yet my colleagues comment on a detail of state post-conviction review that has no bearing on whether Zack can revive his federal litigation.
The panel opinion also suggests that prompt appointment is necessary "to make the process work properly," Majority Op. at 16 n.1 (quoting Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 Ct. Comm. 1993 Adoption), but this appeal is an odd place to express this concern. Zack received post-conviction counsel, and the delay did nothing to prevent Zack from obtaining full collateral review in state court. Indeed, the state granted Zack an extension of time to file a motion for state collateral review, Majority Op. at 5, and the Florida Supreme Court denied relief only after thoroughly reviewing Zack's arguments. See Zack v. State, 911 So. 2d 1190 (Fla. 2005). And, were this not enough process, Zack has pursued federal habeas relief for over 12 years and obtained review of his claim under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002). See Majority Op. at 6-9. This Byzantine litigation has yielded exactly zero meritorious claims and has only delayed justice for the people of Florida and especially for the family of the woman Zack murdered, sexually assaulted, and robbed in 1996. See Zack v. State, 753 So. 2d 9, 12-15 (Fla. 2000). My colleagues assume that every state prisoner sentenced to death should file a federal petition. I do not share that assumption. When a state prisoner has had a trial, direct appeal, and state collateral review, he is presumed to be guilty. And if this prisoner misses a federal deadline for additional rounds of collateral review, I do not assume that an injustice has occurred. Indeed, I voted against granting Zack a certificate of appealability to pursue this appeal because his arguments were patently frivolous.
