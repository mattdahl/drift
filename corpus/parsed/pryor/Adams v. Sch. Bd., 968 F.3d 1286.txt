Not long ago, a suit challenging the lawfulness of separating bathrooms on the basis of sex would have been unthinkable. This practice has long been the common-sense example of an acceptable classification on the basis of sex. And for good reason: it protects well-established privacy interests in using the bathroom away from the opposite sex. Although the Supreme Court recently considered the relationship between transgender status and sex in the context of claims of employment discrimination under Title VII, it declined to consider the permissibility of sex-separated bathrooms. See Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1753, 207 L. Ed. 2d 218 (2020); see also id. at 1739 (assuming that "sex" refers "only to biological distinctions between male and female"). After all, context matters. As the late Justice Thurgood Marshall once put it, "A sign that says 'men only' looks very different on a bathroom door than a courthouse door." City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 468-69, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985) (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).
Against this backdrop, the St. John's County School Board has long enforced a policy that separates the bathrooms in its elementary and secondary schools by sex. And yet the majority rules this policy illegal—indeed unconstitutional—in an opinion that distorts the policy, misunderstands the legal claims asserted, and rewrites well-established precedent. By failing to address head-on the lawfulness of sex-separated bathrooms in schools, the majority recasts the school policy as classifying students on the basis of transgender status. And based on this recasting, it reaches the remarkable conclusion that schoolchildren have no sex-specific privacy interests when using the bathroom. The majority opinion purports to allow only plaintiff Drew Adams, a female who identifies as a male, to use the boys' bathroom, but the logic of this decision would require all schoolchildren to use sex-neutral bathrooms. I dissent.
 A. The Bathroom Policy Does Not Violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Because the Equal Protection Clause "does not make sex a proscribed classification," a policy that classifies on the basis of sex is constitutional if it survives the two requirements of intermediate scrutiny. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1996). The government first must prove that the "classification serves important governmental objectives." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). For an objective to be "important," it cannot stem from "overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females." Id. The objective must also be "genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation." Id. In addition to proving that its policy serves important objectives, the government must prove that "the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Under this well-established standard, this appeal is not complicated. Although the school policy classifies on the basis of sex, it serves the important objectives of protecting the interests of children in using the bathroom away from the opposite sex and in shielding their bodies from exposure to the opposite sex. The policy also fits tightly with both interests in privacy. By requiring students to use the bathroom away from the opposite sex, the policy directly protects the first interest and eliminates one of the most likely opportunities for a violation of the second interest. In short, it easily satisfies intermediate scrutiny, and even if questions remained, the Supreme Court has long required that we defer to the judgment of public-school officials in this context.
The schools' first objective—to protect students' interest in using the bathroom away from the opposite sex—is important. As then-Professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained, "Separate places to disrobe, sleep, [and] perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy." Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Fear of the Equal Rights Amendment, Wash. Post, Apr. 7, 1975, at A21. Indeed, "[a]cross societies and throughout history, it has been commonplace and universally accepted to separate public restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of biological sex in order to address privacy and safety concerns arising from the biological differences between males and females." G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 734 (4th Cir. 2016) (Niemeyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), vacated, 137 S. Ct. 1239, 197 L. Ed. 2d 460 (2017). Separating bathrooms based on sex "dates back as far as written history will take us." W. Burlette Carter, Sexism in the "Bathroom Debates," 37 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 227, 287-88 (2018); see also id. at 258-61 (documenting sex-separated bathrooms in feudal Japan and in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome).
Unsurprisingly, the Supreme Court and our sister circuits have long acknowledged a privacy interest in using the bathroom away from the opposite sex. Even as it ordered the Virginia Military Institute to enroll women, the Supreme Court acknowledged that "[a]dmitting women to VMI would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements." Virginia, 518 U.S. at 550 n.19 (citing Brief for Petitioner at 27-29 (arguing that integrating the institute would not require the sexes to be together "when sleeping, dressing and using the bathroom")). Our sister circuits have likewise accepted that "the law tolerates same-sex restrooms . . . to accommodate privacy needs." Chaney v. Plainfield Healthcare Ctr., 612 F.3d 908, 913 (7th Cir. 2010); accord Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993); Cumbey v. Meachum, 684 F.2d 712, 714 (10th Cir. 1982); see also, e.g., Women Prisoners of the D.C. Dep't of Corr. v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910, 926, 320 U.S. App. D.C. 247 (D.C. Cir. 1996) ("[S]egregation of inmates by sex is unquestionably constitutional."). This privacy interest has long been "appropriately harmonized" with the principle of equality. Ginsburg, Equal Rights Amendment, supra.
The schools' policy is also "substantially related to the achievement" of its objective to protect this privacy interest. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the policy is a mirror image of its objective—it protects students from using the bathroom with the opposite sex by separating bathrooms on the basis of sex. The policy "is not a means to some greater end, but an end in itself." Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 572, 111 S. Ct. 2456, 115 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1991) (plurality opinion). Intermediate scrutiny is satisfied when a policy directly achieves the objective itself. See id.
This conclusion does not turn on Adams's sex. The district court found that the St. John's County School District educates about 40,000 children, and of all those students, the Board is aware of only 16 transgender students. Even if the district court were correct that gender identity, not biology, determines a person's sex—that is, the school policy should have assigned these 16 students to the bathroom that aligned with their gender identity—the policy would still be 99.96 percent accurate in separating bathrooms by sex. This near-perfect result is certainly enough to satisfy intermediate scrutiny, which does not "require[] that the [policy] under consideration must be capable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance." Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 70, 121 S. Ct. 2053, 150 L. Ed. 2d 115 (2001); see also Michael M. v. Super. Ct. of Sonoma Cty., 450 U.S. 464, 473, 101 S. Ct. 1200, 67 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1981) (plurality opinion) ("The relevant inquiry . . . is not whether the statute is drawn as precisely as it might have been . . . .").
Nor does it matter that Adams brings an as-applied challenge to the bathroom policy. "[C]lassifying a lawsuit as facial or as-applied . . . does not speak at all to the substantive rule of law necessary to establish a constitutional violation." Bucklew v. Precythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1127, 203 L. Ed. 2d 521 (2019). And, to reiterate, intermediate scrutiny does not "require[] that the [policy] under consideration must be capable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance." Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70. Demanding that the policy satisfy its privacy interests as to each plaintiff who brings an as-applied challenge would disregard intermediate scrutiny by demanding a perfect fit between the sex-based classification and the government interest at issue.
The school policy also substantially advances its objective to protect children from exposing their unclothed bodies to the opposite sex. Courts have long understood that the "special sense of privacy" that individuals hold in avoiding bodily exposure is heightened "in the presence of people of the other sex." Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord, e.g., Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 446 (1st Cir. 1991); Harris v. Miller, 818 F.3d 49, 59 (2d Cir. 2016); Doe v. Luzerne Cty., 660 F.3d 169, 177 (3d Cir. 2011); Strickler v. Waters, 989 F.2d 1375, 1387 (4th Cir. 1993); Moore v. Carwell, 168 F.3d 234, 236-37 (5th Cir. 1999); Brannum v. Overton Cty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008); Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183, 185 (7th Cir. 1994); Byrd v. Maricopa Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 629 F.3d 1135, 1141 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc); Hayes v. Marriott, 70 F.3d 1144, 1146 (10th Cir. 1995). And separating bathrooms by sex eliminates one of the most common opportunities for exposure to the opposite sex. The district court acknowledged the undisputed testimony that students at Adams's school change clothing outside bathroom stalls and that bathrooms are ordinarily unsupervised. By separating bathrooms by sex, the policy eliminates the risk of bodily exposure where it is most likely to occur, which satisfies intermediate scrutiny. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70 (holding that a policy that "seeks to foster the opportunity" for a government objective "has a close and substantial bearing on" that objective).
Even if any doubt remained about whether the bathroom policy survives scrutiny, we must resolve that doubt in favor of the Board because the policy governs student conduct in public schools. The Supreme Court has long held that the constitutional rights of students, including "Fourteenth Amendment rights, are different in public schools than elsewhere." Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 656, 115 S. Ct. 2386, 132 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1995). Schools have a "custodial and tutelary" power over minor students, "permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults." Id. at 655. For that reason, the Supreme Court has long deferred to the decisions of school districts in a variety of constitutional contexts, including when determining whether a suspicionless drug search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, id. at 665, whether the censorship of certain speech was acceptable under the First Amendment, Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 403-06, 409-410, 127 S. Ct. 2618, 168 L. Ed. 2d 290 (2007) (collecting decisions), and whether corporal punishment was cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment, Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 681-82, 97 S. Ct. 1401, 51 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1977).
The bathroom policy falls squarely within the Board's authority to "prescribe and control conduct" in its schools. Id. at 682 (internal quotation marks omitted). "[I]n a public school environment . . . the State is responsible for maintaining discipline, health, and safety." Bd. of Educ. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 830, 122 S. Ct. 2559, 153 L. Ed. 2d 735 (2002); see also Fla. Stat. § 1001.42(8)(a) (making school boards responsible for the "control of students at school, and for proper attention to health, safety, and other matters relating to the welfare of students"). This responsibility is so weighty that school districts can be liable for sexual assault and harassment between students. See Miami-Dade Cty. Sch. Bd. v. A.N., 905 So. 2d 203, 203-04, 206 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005) (upholding a jury verdict against a school for failing to protect a student who was sexually assaulted in a bathroom by another student); see also Williams v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 477 F.3d 1282, 1299 (11th Cir. 2007). And bathrooms, one of the few areas in a school that are unsupervised, plainly pose risks to student "discipline, health, and safety." Earls, 536 U.S. at 830; see also A.N., 905 So. 2d at 203-04, 206. The Board's assessment of the privacy risks its students face and the effectiveness of its policy in mitigating those risks deserves deference.
The majority opinion elides this entire analysis by misunderstanding both the classification and privacy interests at issue. It contends that the policy triggers heightened scrutiny not because it separates bathrooms by sex but because it purportedly imposes "differential treatment" on transgender students. Majority Op. at 12. In doing so, the majority misstates the school policy, conflates sex-based classifications with transgender-based classifications, and contravenes Supreme Court precedent. Compounding its errors, the majority then ignores fundamental understandings of why bathrooms are separated on the basis of sex by rejecting long-standing privacy rationales for sex-separated bathrooms. This conclusion leads it to fault the objective underlying the school policy as both hypothetical and based on impermissible stereotypes. After misconstruing both the classification and the privacy interests at issue—the only two ingredients of intermediate scrutiny—the majority opinion then concludes that the schools' classification does not substantially advance a valid objective. I take each of these errors in turn.
The majority's conclusion that the school policy classifies on the basis of sex because it "singles out transgender students" is both central to its analysis and wrong. Id. The majority opinion reaches this incorrect conclusion by pointing to a provision of the school policy that does not have that effect. The majority opinion says the school policy targets transgender students because of the following provision: "Transgender students will be given access to a gender-neutral restroom and will not be required to use the restroom corresponding to their biological sex." Id. But this provision only offers the option of using gender-neural bathrooms as an alternative to the bathroom that matches a child's sex. It is an accommodation for transgender students, not a special burden. What Adams actually challenges is the requirement that students cannot use the bathrooms of the opposite sex, which long predates the provision that accommodates transgender students. It is this policy that "prohibit[s] . . . transgender students from using the restrooms matching their gender identity." Id. at 14. Because this policy divides bathrooms by sex, not transgender status, it does not facially classify on the basis of transgender status.
The decision of the Supreme Court in Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 94 S. Ct. 2485, 41 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1974), is instructive. There, the Court held that a state insurance policy that excluded coverage for pregnancies did not classify on the basis of sex. Id. at 495-97. It explained that the classification at issue created two groups—pregnant and nonpregnant people. Id. at 496 n.20. Although "the first group is exclusively female," the Court explained, "the second includes members of both sexes," which revealed a "lack of identity" between pregnancy and sex. Id.; see also Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 271, 113 S. Ct. 753, 122 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1993) (reaffirming this reasoning). This analysis applies with equal force here. The bathroom policy creates two groups—students who can use the boys' bathroom and students who can use the girls' bathroom. Both groups contain transgender students and non-transgender students, so a "lack of identity" exists between the policy and transgender status. Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.
At most, the policy has a disparate impact on transgender students, which is not enough to create a sex-based classification. Facially neutral policies trigger intermediate scrutiny only if "invidious gender-based discrimination" motivated them. Pers. Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 60 L. Ed. 2d 870 (1979); see also Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977) ("Proof of . . . discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause."). Adams cannot argue that a discriminatory purpose against transgender students motivated the policy. Although the district court found that the Board acted with discriminatory intent because it failed to update its policies when it became "aware of the need to treat transgender students the same as other students," the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that "[d]iscriminatory purpose . . . implies more than . . . awareness of consequences." E.g., Bray, 113 S. Ct. at 760 (internal quotation marks omitted); Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (internal quotation marks omitted). It instead requires the Board to act "at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' . . . adverse effects upon an identifiable group." Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. The district court found that the "School Board did not have transgender students in mind when it originally established separate multi-stall restrooms for boys and girls," which precludes a finding of discriminatory intent.
The decision of the Supreme Court in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 207 L. Ed. 2d 218, is not to the contrary. To be sure, Bostock clarified that "discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex" in the context of employment discrimination under Title VII. Id. at 1747; see also Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that discrimination based on gender nonconformity constitutes sex discrimination regardless of whether the victim is transgender or not). But this appeal concerns the converse question: whether discrimination on the basis of sex necessarily entails discrimination based on transgender status. Of course, a policy can classify on the basis of sex without also classifying on the basis of transgender status. See, e.g., Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60. Indeed, Bostock expressly disclaimed reaching any conclusion on the permissibility of sex-separated bathrooms and locker rooms. See 140 S. Ct. at 1753.
The majority's misunderstanding of the classification at issue infects its constitutional inquiry. Intermediate scrutiny turns on the relationship between the classification at issue and the government's objectives—that is, whether a sex-based classification is substantially related to the government's objectives. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60. So the relevant question is whether excluding students of one sex from the bathroom of the other sex substantially advances the schools' privacy objectives. The question is not, as the majority frames it, whether excluding transgender students from the bathroom of their choice furthers important privacy objectives. The majority's misunderstanding of the classification as based on transgender status gerrymanders its analysis to the second question.
Consider the majority's assertion that the bathroom policy cannot satisfy intermediate scrutiny because it is arbitrary. See, e.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 201-04, 97 S. Ct. 451, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1976) (holding that a statute failed intermediate scrutiny when the relationship between the sex-based classification and government interest was "unduly tenuous"). The district court found that the school district determines each child's sex by looking to the enrollment forms that the student provides when the student enrolls, which includes the student's birth certificate. The majority explains that a transgender student who changed the sex on his birth certificate before enrolling could use the bathroom matching his gender identity and not his sex. See generally Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 64V-1.003(2)(c), (4)(b) (allowing amendments to birth certificates with medical documentation). According to the majority, this process for determining sex fails to achieve the "stated goal of restricting transgender students to the restroom of their assigned sex at birth" because the enrollment documents are not "legitimate, accurate prox[ies]" for determining a transgender student's "sex assigned at birth." Majority Op. at 18 (quoting Craig, 429 U.S. at 204).
This argument fails when we remember that the goal of the policy is to restrict all students, not only transgender students, from the bathroom of the opposite sex. Birth certificates are an almost perfect proxy for determining a student's sex. Even if all transgender students in the school district used bathrooms that did not align with their sex, the policy would still be 99.96 percent accurate in separating bathrooms by sex, which satisfies intermediate scrutiny. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70. To close the supposed loophole that the majority identifies, schools in the district would need to target transgender students. Of course, intermediate scrutiny does not require that approach. See id. at 63 ("The Constitution . . . does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism . . . even if that mechanism arguably might be the most scientifically advanced method.").
In addition to misunderstanding the classification at issue, the majority erroneously redefines the privacy interests at stake. Although the majority concedes that protecting bathroom privacy, in some abstract sense, is an important objective, it rejects both of the privacy interests that the school policy protects. For the first interest, the majority asserts that the Board incorrectly decided that its students had any privacy interest in using the bathroom away from "students who do not share the same birth sex." Majority Op. at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted). And although the majority appears to acknowledge that students have a privacy interest in not exposing their bodies, it does not accept that this interest can be sex-specific—that the interest is heightened when exposure is to the opposite sex. Instead, it asserts not only that Adams's "anatomical differences" from boys are "irrelevant" to bathroom privacy, id. at 24, but also that thinking otherwise is an unconstitutional stereotype, id. at 25-28.
The majority's understanding of each interest contravenes precedent. Its decision to limit students' privacy interest to bodily exposure ignores that children also have a distinct privacy interest in using the bathroom away from the opposite sex. See, e.g., Virginia, 518 U.S. at 550 n.19; Chaney, 612 F.3d at 913; Faulkner, 10 F.3d at 232; Cumbey, 684 F.2d at 714; see also Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 626, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1989) (concluding that urination is "an excretory function traditionally shielded by great privacy"). Similarly, the majority's failure to acknowledge that the privacy interest in avoiding bodily exposure is heightened when children of the opposite sex are present ignores longstanding precedent, not to mention common sense. See, e.g., Fortner, 983 F.2d at 1030; Harris, 818 F.3d at 59; Luzerne Cty., 660 F.3d at 177; Overton Cty., 516 F.3d at 494; Canedy, 16 F.3d at 185.
Finally, the majority's alternative contention that the privacy interests at issue are invalid because they rest on impermissible sex stereotypes is incorrect. According to the majority, the school policy "presumed every person deemed 'male' at birth would act and identify as a 'boy' and every person deemed 'female' would act and identify as a 'girl.'" Majority Op. at 26. The majority also faults the policy for indulging in the purportedly unconstitutional stereotype that "one's gender identity and expression should align with one's birth sex." Id. Neither of these arguments has merit.
The majority never explains how the school policy "presume[d] every person deemed 'male' at birth would act and identify as a 'boy' and every person deemed 'female' would act and identify as a 'girl.'" Nor can it. The policy does not turn on how students "act and identify." It assigns bathrooms by sex, which is not a stereotype. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73 ("Mechanistic classification of all our differences as stereotypes would operate to obscure those misconceptions and prejudices that are real."); Etsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1224 (10th Cir. 2007) ("Use of a restroom designated for the opposite sex does not constitute a mere failure to conform to sex stereotypes.").
The majority's other contention—that believing "one's gender identity and expression should align with one's birth sex" is an unconstitutional stereotype—fares no better. The Supreme Court has long grounded its sex-discrimination jurisprudence in reproductive biology. See, e.g., Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73 ("The difference between men and women in relation to the birth process is a real one . . . ."); Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20 ("[I]t is true that only women can become pregnant . . . ."); see also Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 ("Physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring: [T]he two sexes are not fungible . . . ." (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the Court's justification for giving heightened scrutiny to sex-based classifications makes sense only with reference to physiology.
In one of its foundational sex-discrimination decisions, the Court justified heightened scrutiny this way: "since sex . . . is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility." Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1973) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the Court endorsed heightened scrutiny because laws "distributing benefits and burdens between the sexes in different ways very likely reflect outmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men and women." Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. To say that it is an unconstitutional stereotype to believe that "one's gender identity and expression should align with one's birth sex," the majority must not only rewrite the Supreme Court's physiological rationale for heightened scrutiny of sex-based classifications, but also hold that many of the Court's sex-discrimination decisions turned on an impermissible stereotype. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73; Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533; Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20; Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 686. We, of course, cannot take either of those actions.
The majority's narrow construction of bathroom privacy skews the intermediate-scrutiny analysis in favor of Adams. Policies that separate bathrooms on the basis of sex arise from the understanding that privacy interests are sometimes sex specific. By failing to acknowledge any sex-specific privacy interest, the majority demands the impossible: a justification for sex-separated bathrooms that does not involve sex. To be sure, the majority suggests that a different trial record—one that contained evidence that Adams or other transgender students "harass[ed] or peep[ed] at" other students in the bathroom—might support the bathroom policy. Majority Op. at 21. But that evidence would not justify a sex-based classification. If voyeurism is equally problematic whether it occurs between children of the same or opposite sex, then separating bathrooms by sex would not advance any interest in combatting voyeurism. Only single-stall bathrooms could address that concern. Further, under intermediate scrutiny, an invidious stereotype about members of a suspect class cannot justify a discriminatory policy "even when some statistical support can be conjured up for the generalization." J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 139 n.11, 114 S. Ct. 1419, 128 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1994). So evidence that children of a particular sex—or transgender students under the majority's perspective—are likely to "harass or peep at" members of the opposite sex could not justify sex-separated bathrooms.
Only after it replaces both of the inquiries relevant to intermediate scrutiny—the "discriminatory means employed" by the policy and the privacy interests at issue, Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (internal quotation marks omitted)—does the majority conclude that the school policy does not substantially advance its objective to protect privacy. The end result is an opinion on sex discrimination that looks nothing like an intermediate-scrutiny inquiry into whether a sex-based classification satisfies the Equal Protection Clause.
The majority's redefinition of intermediate scrutiny will have consequences far beyond the confines of this appeal. The logic of its opinion would invalidate all government policies that separate bathrooms—or locker rooms and showers, for that matter—by sex. To be sure, the majority "assume[s]" that the government can promote privacy interests by separating bathrooms by sex, and it insists that the lawfulness of sex-separated locker rooms is not before it. Majority Op. at 8 n.3, 14. But anyone can take advantage of the majority's demolition of sex-specific bathroom privacy.
That the majority purports to invalidate the school policy only as it applies to Adams changes nothing. See Bucklew, 139 S. Ct. at 1127. The majority does not offer a meaningful way to distinguish this appeal from one that challenges sex-separated bathrooms and locker rooms. It only insists that the issue is not before it. But do not be fooled: future plaintiffs can still leverage the majority's narrow view of privacy. Ultimately, if the privacy interest at stake is untethered from using the bathroom away from the opposite sex or from biological differences between the sexes, then no justification exists for separating bathrooms—or any related facility—by sex.
When shorn of the majority's misunderstandings of the school policy and the legal standards that govern sex-based classifications, this appeal is straightforward. The school policy protects longstanding privacy interests inherent in using the bathroom, and it does so in an ancient and unremarkable way—by separating bathrooms on the basis of sex. That policy is not unconstitutional.
 B. The Bathroom Policy Does Not Violate Title IX.
Title IX mandates that no person "shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). But an important qualification tempers this mandate: "nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes." Id. § 1686. The implementing regulations clarify that institutions "may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex." 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.
Whether the Board violated Title IX turns on the answer to one question: what does "sex" mean in Title IX? Regardless of whether separating bathrooms by sex would otherwise constitute discrimination "on the basis of sex," 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), the bathroom policy does not violate Title IX if it falls within the safe harbor for "separate toilet . . . facilities on the basis of sex." 34 C.F.R § 106.33. And if the school policy is valid under Title IX, then Title IX also permits the schools to require all students, including Adams, to follow that policy. Cf. Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts § 30, at 192-93 (2012) ("[W]henever a power is given by a statute, everything necessary to making it effectual or requisite to attaining the end is implied." (quoting 1 James Kent, Commentaries on American Law *464)).
Contrary to the majority's and Adams's arguments otherwise, the Supreme Court did not resolve this question in Bostock. Far from it. Not only did the Court "proceed on the assumption that 'sex' . . . refer[s] only to biological distinctions between male and female," it disclaimed deciding whether Title VII allows for sex-separated bathrooms. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1739, 1753. And any guidance Bostock might otherwise provide about whether Title VII allows for sex-separated bathrooms does not extend to Title IX, which permits schools to act on the basis of sex through sex-separated bathrooms. See 20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.
Turning to the provisions at issue, this question is not close. As used in Title IX and its implementing regulations, "sex" unambiguously is a classification on the basis of reproductive function. We must, of course, give words in statutes the ordinary meaning they conveyed when Congress enacted them. See New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, 139 S. Ct. 532, 539, 202 L. Ed. 2d 536 (2019); Scalia & Garner, Reading Law §§ 6-7, at 69-71, 78-79. And "sex" has never meant gender identity. See, e.g., Sex, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1979) ("The property or quality by which organisms are classified according to their reproductive functions."); Sex, The Random House College Dictionary (1980) ("either the male or female division of a species, esp. as differentiated with reference to the reproductive functions"); see also Am. Psychiatric Ass'n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) ("This chapter employs constructs and terms as they are widely used by clinicians from various disciplines with specialization in this area. In this chapter, sex and sexual refer to the biological indicators of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity) . . . .").
That "sex" did not mean gender identity is unsurprising. When Congress enacted Title IX in 1972, psychiatric literature conflated sexual orientation with gender identity. See Jack Drescher, Transsexualism, Gender Identity Disorder and the DSM, 14 J. Gay & Lesbian Mental Health 109, 111 (2010). And as with homosexuality, a common belief among psychiatrists was that "trans people [were] severely mentally disturbed." See id. at 114, 116-17. Indeed, the American Psychiatric Association first classified "Gender Identity Disorders" as psychosexual disorders in which a person's internal sense of gender did not align with his or her anatomy. See Am. Psychiatric Ass'n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 261 (3d ed. 1980). Consistent with this view, "[m]ainstream medical thinking" when Title IX became law was firmly opposed to sex-reassignment surgery. Drescher, supra, at 111-12. Even among its proponents, "[s]ex reassignment was . . . considered not a cure, but a palliative treatment." Dallas Denny, A Selective Bibliography of Transsexualism, 6 J. Gay & Lesbian Psychotherapy 35, 38 (2002). It is untenable to construe transgender status, which even the medical community saw as a departure from the norm, as altering the norm itself among the general public.
In deciding otherwise, the majority erroneously concludes that the safe harbor for bathrooms does not apply because Title IX and its regulations do not "declare" whether "sex" as applied to Adams is the "sex identified at birth"—female—or the sex listed on Adams's amended birth certificate and driver's license—male. Majority Op. at 40-41 (quoting Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1746). But the ordinary meaning of "sex" in the safe-harbor provision does not change when a plaintiff is transgender. See Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v. U.S. ex rel. Hunt, 139 S. Ct. 1507, 1512, 203 L. Ed. 2d 791 (2019) ("In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed meaning."). And as explained above, the ordinary meaning of "sex" when Congress enacted Title IX turned on reproductive function. That Congress did not define "sex" does not change this conclusion. See United States v. Sepulveda, 115 F.3d 882, 886 n.9 (11th Cir. 1997) ("[A] statute is not ambiguous merely because it contains a term without a statutory definition."). And under the unambiguous meaning of "sex" in the safe-harbor provision, the Board did not violate Title IX when it prohibited Adams from using the boys' bathroom.
Instead of grappling with the meaning of "sex," the majority abdicates its duty to interpret the law. According to the majority, it is unnecessary to delve into the meaning of "sex" in Title IX because the safe harbor "does not dictate how schools should approach transgender students' restroom use." Majority Op. at 42. But courts regularly apply general standards of law to particular facts, and the Board asks this Court to apply the safe-harbor provision to the facts in this appeal. By declaring it not "necessary" to interpret the safe-harbor provision, the majority abandons statutory interpretation in favor of legislating a transgender exception to the safe-harbor provision. This approach offends basic principles of statutory interpretation. See Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 8, at 93 ("The principle that a matter not covered is not covered is so obvious that it seems absurd to recite it. The judge should not presume that every statute answers every question . . . . Nor should the judge elaborate unprovided-for exceptions to a text . . . ."); EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2033, 192 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015) ("We construe [a statute's] silence as exactly that: silence.").
Indeed, the majority turns Title IX on its head by requiring a clear statement from Congress that the safe harbor protects the Board. Because Congress enacted Title IX under its Spending Clause power, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1, the Board's violation must be unambiguous to trigger liability. Although the Spending Clause allows Congress to "attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds," South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206, 107 S. Ct. 2793, 97 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1987), "[t]he legitimacy of Congress' power to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the 'contract.'" Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S. Ct. 1531, 67 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1981). In other words, "if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously." Id. This requirement unquestionably applies when courts interpret Title IX. See Davis ex rel. D. v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 649-50, 119 S. Ct. 1661, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1999). It also applies when the appellant fails to press the issue in the district court. See Jefferson v. Sewon Am., Inc., 891 F.3d 911, 923 (11th Cir. 2018) ("[P]arties cannot waive the application of the correct law."). So even if the majority were correct that "sex" was ambiguous, Title IX still would not prohibit the Board's actions. Instead, the Board would lose the protection of the bathroom safe harbor only if the meaning of "sex" unambiguously did not turn on reproductive function.
For its part, the district court ruled that the Board violated Title IX for different but equally flawed reasons. It first ruled that the meaning of "sex" in Title IX was ambiguous because the statute did not define the term and dictionary definitions of "sex" were not "so universally clear" at the time. It then held that our decision in Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, and the Supreme Court's decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion), supported its conclusion that "sex" in Title IX "includes 'gender identity' for purposes of its application to transgender students."
A statutory term is not ambiguous solely because a statute does not define it or because an isolated dictionary suggests a divergent meaning. See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1994) ("Ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context . . . ."). Further, the only purportedly competing definition the district court found—that "sex" means "the character of being either male or female," Sex, American College Dictionary (1970)—supports a biological meaning of sex. That dictionary defined "female" and "male" in physiological, reproductive terms. See Female, id. ("a human being of the sex which conceives and brings forth young; a woman or girl"); Male, id. ("belonging to the sex which begets young, or any division or group corresponding to it"). The district court had no reason to conclude that the term was ambiguous.
The decision to resolve the purported ambiguity as applied to transgender students with Price Waterhouse and Glenn fares no better. Like the majority, the district court erred by assuming that "sex" could have different meanings as applied to transgender and non-transgender persons. See Cochise Consultancy, 139 S. Ct. at 1512. Further, neither Price Waterhouse nor Glenn redefined the meaning of "sex." They held only that when an employer acts against a member of one sex for failing to conform to stereotypes associated with that sex—for example, dressing like the opposite sex—that employer has acted because of sex. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 250 (holding that an employer discriminated on the basis of sex when he "act[ed] on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be"); Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1318-19 ("All persons, whether transgender or not, are protected from discrimination on the basis of gender stereotype. . . . Because these protections are afforded to everyone, they cannot be denied to a transgender individual."). Whether or not the Board based its policy on sex stereotypes does not matter for this claim because that question would determine only whether the Board acted "on the basis of sex." 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Title IX and its regulations expressly allow the Board to do so to provide separate bathrooms. See id. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.
Like the majority, the district court also failed to grapple with the fact that Congress enacted Title IX under its Spending Clause power. As explained above, the district court could impose liability only if it concluded that the meaning of "sex" in Title IX unambiguously did not turn on reproductive function. In other words, even if the district court were correct that "sex" was ambiguous and that the best interpretation of "sex" when Congress enacted Title IX was gender identity—and, to reiterate, it was not on either count—Title IX still would not prohibit a school from separating bathrooms on the basis of sex.
* * *
The majority transforms an appeal that it should have resolved with straightforward applications of intermediate scrutiny and statutory interpretation into something unrecognizable. Almost no aspect of its analysis emerges unscathed. The majority misunderstands the policy at issue, ignores decades of precedent, dismisses any sex-specific interest in bathroom privacy, and flouts foundational principles of statutory interpretation. In the process, it issues a holding with radical consequences for sex-separated bathrooms. But for all of its errors, the majority opinion cannot obscure what should have been the bottom line of this appeal: there is nothing unlawful, under either the Constitution or federal law, about a policy that separates bathrooms for schoolchildren on the basis of sex.
I dissent.
