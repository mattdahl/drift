, respecting the denial of rehearing en banc:
Consider a hypothetical. A defendant is convicted of a federal crime and sentenced  to a term of imprisonment. His conviction and sentence are affirmed on appeal. He brings a collateral challenge, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a), but it fails. Perhaps he brings more than one collateral challenge; all of them fail. Eventually, in some other case, the Supreme Court announces a new rule of law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. But the new rule plainly cannot benefit the prisoner—either because it does not apply to his situation or because applying it would make no difference to his conviction or sentence. Even so, he applies to this Court for permission to file a second, third, or umpteenth collateral challenge based on the new rule. Does the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act require that we grant his application and create unnecessary work for the district court? Judge Martin's dissent appears to contend that the answer is "yes." Our Court has disagreed.
I join Judge Tjoflat's opinion in full, but I write separately to answer our colleague's challenge and to defend our commonsense practice of denying prisoners' applications to file doomed collateral challenges that cannot possibly bring them relief. The basis of our colleague's argument that denying these applications contravenes "the plain mandate" of the Act is not entirely clear. Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 60. Her dissent draws an insistent but far from self-explanatory distinction between a "prima facie showing" and a "merits decision," and it suggests that we held in In re Holladay, 331 F.3d 1169 (11th Cir. 2003), that our prima facie assessment of a prisoner's application to file a second or successive collateral challenge must not touch "the merits" of the claims the prisoner wishes to raise. But we explained in Holladay itself—indeed, we said it was "manifestly obvious"—that we would deny applications that had no "reasonable likelihood" of resulting in relief. Id. at 1173. After all, whenever a circuit court denies an application for a second or successive motion, it necessarily decides that the application has no merit. And the circuit courts collectively deny thousands of these applications on the merits every year.
To vindicate the strong interest in the finality of fully litigated criminal convictions, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act imposes "stringent requirements for the filing of a second or successive [collateral challenge]," id. (quoting Bennett v. United States, 119 F.3d 468, 469-70 (7th Cir. 1997)), and, as Judge Martin's dissent acknowledges, it gives courts of appeals "a gatekeeping function" with respect to the enforcement of those requirements, Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 84. Before a federal prisoner may file a second or successive section 2255 motion in the district court, he must apply to "the appropriate court of appeals" for permission to do so. 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A); see id. § 2255(h) (incorporating these procedures for federal prisoners). The court of appeals must then "certif[y] as provided in section 2244" that the motion will "contain—
(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or
(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable."
Id. § 2255(h); see also id. § 2244(b)(2) (analogous requirements for state prisoners with minor differences in wording). We are permitted to authorize a second or successive challenge only if we "determine[] that the application makes a prima  facie showing that [it] satisfies the[se] requirements." Id. § 2244(b)(3)(C).
Judge Martin's dissent revolves around the three words "prima facie showing," but that phrase does not interpret itself. Often, a "prima facie case" or "prima facie showing" refers to what a plaintiff must prove to shift the burden of proof or production to the defendant. See Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 69 (citing Black's Law Dictionary for a definition in this vein). The dissent provides as two examples the burden-shifting frameworks that govern claims of racial discrimination in jury selection, see Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), and workplace discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 69-71. In these frameworks, "prima facie showing" has a purely formal meaning: it defines the set of elements proof of which suffices to raise a presumption of liability, subject to rebuttal if the defense meets some specified burden of its own.
But this formal sense of the phrase "prima facie showing" does not fit section 2244(b)(3)(C). The statutory restrictions on second or successive collateral challenges plainly do not set up a burden-shifting framework. A prisoner's prima facie showing of compliance with section 2255(h) does not create any presumption that the government must rebut with an adequate showing of its own. Indeed, the prima facie showing does not even create a presumption of compliance with section 2255(h); the district court approaches that question de novo. See In re Moss, 703 F.3d 1301, 1303 (11th Cir. 2013). So how does our "prima facie" inspection of the prisoner's application differ from the district court's plenary assessment? The Act demands an answer to this question, but the dissent's analogies to burden-shifting frameworks do not help us find it.
When "prima facie showing" cannot bear a formal definition, it sometimes bears instead a functional meaning. For example, the Board of Immigration Appeals describes the standard for reopening of removal proceedings as requiring "a prima facie showing of eligibility" for the relief sought. In re L-O-G-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 413, 415 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Sipus, 14 I. & N. Dec. 229, 230 (BIA 1972) (referring to "a prima facie case for reopening"). Judge Martin's dissent provides this example, see Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 71-72, but it undermines the argument that "prima facie showing" has a rigid meaning that categorically excludes consideration of the merits. The Board has made clear that "[n]o hard and fast rule can be laid down as to what constitutes a sufficient showing of a prima facie case for reopening." Sipus, 14 I. & N. Dec. at 231; accord L-O-G-, 21 I. & N. Dec. at 418 ("[T]here are no easy rules for deciding what makes a prima facie case . . . and what does not.").
Instead, in this context, a prima facie showing is simply whatever "satisf[ies] [the Board] that it would be worthwhile to develop the issues further at a plenary hearing on reopening." Sipus, 14 I. & N. Dec. at 231. This standard is not blind to the merits. On the contrary, it requires "a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits" in the judgment of the Board, and, under this standard, the Board has denied motions for reopening for a variety of merits-related reasons. L-O-G-, 21 I. & N. Dec. at 420. For example, in Sipus, the movant's "new facts" were plainly inadequate to support eligibility for relief, so the Board could not "infer . . . that she [might] be able to prove [eligibility] if given a chance at a reopened hearing." 14 I. & N. Dec. at 231. The Board has also denied a  motion for reopening based on its discretionary determination in the first instance that the movant had been convicted of "a particularly serious crime," making him legally ineligible for relief. In re S-V-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1306, 1309 (BIA 2000), disapproved on other grounds by Amir v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 921, 927 (6th Cir. 2006).
In the foundational decision about section 2244(b)(3)(C), the Seventh Circuit interpreted it to include a similar "worthwhileness" standard: "By 'prima facie showing' we understand . . . simply a sufficient showing of possible merit to warrant a fuller exploration by the district court." Bennett, 119 F.3d at 469. The Seventh Circuit made clear that this definition did not treat "prima facie showing" as a legal term of art with a formal meaning because it was articulated "without guidance in the statutory language or history or case law." Id. In Holladay, we adopted this language from Bennett, see 331 F.3d at 1173-74, and every other numbered circuit has done the same. See Rodriguez v. Superintendent, Bay State Corr. Ctr., 139 F.3d 270, 273 (1st Cir. 1998); Bell v. United States, 296 F.3d 127, 128 (2d Cir. 2002); Goldblum v. Klem, 510 F.3d 204, 219 (3d Cir. 2007); In re Williams, 330 F.3d 277, 281 (4th Cir. 2003); Reyes-Requena v. United States, 243 F.3d 893, 899 (5th Cir. 2001); In re Lott, 366 F.3d 431, 432-33 (6th Cir. 2004); Johnson v. United States, 720 F.3d 720, 720 (8th Cir. 2013); Woratzeck v. Stewart, 118 F.3d 648, 650 (9th Cir. 1997); United States v. Murphy, 887 F.3d 1064, 1068 (10th Cir. 2018).
Although Judge Martin's dissent invokes the Bennett-Holladay standard to lament the supposed good old days "when this Court honored the statutorily imposed limitations of a prima facie review," Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 73, the Seventh Circuit in Bennett did not describe its definition as especially permissive or as one that required courts of appeals to close their eyes to the impossibility of relief. On the contrary, when Donald Bennett sought permission to file a third section 2255 motion under the "newly discovered evidence" gateway for successive motions, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h)(1), the Bennett court stressed that he bore a "very heavy burden" of "ha[ving] to show, albeit only prima facie, that the newly discovered evidence would have established [his innocence] by clear and convincing evidence," and it denied his application because the evidence he relied on was plainly inadequate. 119 F.3d at 469. In part, Bennett's burden was especially heavy because he wanted to relitigate an insanity defense that itself required clear and convincing proof, so his burden of proof was clear-and-convincing squared. See id. But Bennett makes clear that a court of appeals' "prima facie" inspection of an application under section 2255(h) does not require it to close its eyes to the merits altogether. After all, how could "a fuller exploration" be "warrant[ed]," id., when it would serve only to waste the district court's time and be of no use to the prisoner?
Perhaps our colleague would limit the Bennett court's willingness to acknowledge that a motion is certainly doomed to the "newly discovered evidence" gateway, but she cannot take that position and eulogize Holladay at the same time because Holladay followed the same approach with respect to the "new rule" gateway, 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h)(2); see also id. § 2244(b)(2)(A). When Alabama death-row inmate Glenn Holladay sought leave to file a second federal habeas petition based on the Supreme Court's novel holding that the Constitution bars the execution of the mentally retarded, see Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002), we held that Atkins provided a retroactive new rule of constitutional law, but "[i]mportantly"  that holding "[did] not terminate our analysis." 331 F.3d at 1173. Describing the identification of a new rule as "merely . . . the minimum showing that [a petitioner] must make," we held that it was "manifestly obvious that in order to make a prima facie showing" based on Atkins, "Holladay also must demonstrate . . . a reasonable likelihood that he [was] in fact mentally retarded." Id.; accord In re Morris, 328 F.3d 739, 740-41 (5th Cir. 2003); In re Bowling, 422 F.3d 434, 436 (6th Cir. 2005). "Were it otherwise," we reasoned, "literally any prisoner under a death sentence could bring an Atkins claim in a second or successive petition," and "[n]o rational argument can possibly be made" that the Act requires us to permit the inundation of the district courts with wholly meritless second or successive collateral challenges every time the Supreme Court announces a new rule. Holladay, 331 F.3d at 1173 n.1.
Under Holladay's sensible regime, a prisoner cannot discharge his prima facie burden merely by invoking a new rule; as we phrased the standard in a later decision, he must also "show a reasonable likelihood that he would benefit from the new rule he seeks to invoke in a second or successive [challenge]." In re Henry, 757 F.3d 1151, 1162 (11th Cir. 2014); cf. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (distinguishing legal conclusions in a complaint from the "show[ing]" of entitlement to relief required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)). To put it tersely, the prisoner must show that the new rule has some "bearing on his case." Henry, 757 F.3d at 1162.
Judge Martin may disagree with Holladay—as the Tenth Circuit did in a decision that her dissent cites favorably, see Ochoa v. Sirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 545 (10th Cir. 2007)—but in that case she should not invoke its authority while rejecting its rule, which we applied in all of the orders to which her dissent takes exception. See Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 75-77. For example, a prisoner whose sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act "does not turn on the validity of the residual clause," In re Thomas, 823 F.3d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir. 2016), is a prisoner who cannot possibly benefit from the Supreme Court's holding that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague, see Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 192 L. Ed. 2d 569 (2015). So is a prisoner whose conviction for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), or whose sentence under the former career-offender sentencing guideline, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 4B1.1-4B1.2 (Nov. 2015), would stand whether or not Johnson affects section 924(c) or the career-offender guideline. In declining to permit "literally any prisoner under [an Armed Career Criminal Act, section 924(c), or career-offender] sentence [to] bring a[] [Johnson] claim in a second or successive petition," Holladay, 331 F.3d at 1173 n.1, we have not "exceeded [our] statutory mandate," Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 74. Instead, we have executed our statutory mandate as we interpreted it in Holladay, which, as the dissent reminds us, "is still binding precedent for our Circuit." Id. at 73.
The logic of Holladay exposes any rigid dichotomy between a prisoner's "prima facie showing" and "the merits" of his claim as untenable. True, whether Johnson or any other new rule that a prisoner invokes really supports his claim is a question that relates to "the merits." But it is no less true that a prisoner's prima facie showing must include the demonstration that his motion will "contain," 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h)(2), or "rel[y] on," id. § 2244(b)(2)(A), a new rule of constitutional  law, and that requirement demands more than that the prisoner write the magic word "Johnson." If a new rule plainly does not apply to a prisoner's situation or applying it would make no difference to his conviction and sentence, then he necessarily cannot "show a reasonable likelihood that he would benefit from the new rule," and his application fails at the starting gate for the same reason his collateral challenge would fail on the merits. Henry, 757 F.3d at 1162. So it is no wonder that we and other courts have frequently referred to "the merits" in asking whether an application satisfies section 2255(h). See, e.g., In re Baptiste, 828 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir. 2016) (calling the denial of a previous application raising the same claim a "reject[ion] on the merits"); Henry, 757 F.3d at 1157 n.9 ("As the dissenting opinion sees the case, Henry should be entitled to file a second or successive petition under § 2244(b)(2) because he's made a sufficient merits showing."); id. at 1169 (Martin, J., dissenting) ("I must also address the merits of Mr. Henry's case."); id. at 1170 ("I view the merits . . . differently than the Majority."); Ezell v. United States, 778 F.3d 762, 765 (9th Cir. 2015) ("reach[ing] the merits" of a prisoner's application for leave to file a second or successive motion).
There is nothing remotely strange about this partial overlap between a threshold inquiry and the merits. Consider "the somewhat analogous certificate of appealability . . . context," In re Saint Fleur, 824 F.3d 1337, 1343 (11th Cir. 2016) (Martin, J., concurring), in which "[a] certificate of appealability may issue . . . only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right." 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). The Supreme Court has "emphasized" that this inquiry "is not coextensive with a merits analysis." Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773, 197 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2017). But as the Court explained in the same discussion, "[o]f course when a court of appeals . . . determines that a prisoner's claim is not even debatable, that necessarily means the prisoner has failed to show that his claim is meritorious." Id. at 774. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has affirmed the denial of a certificate of appealability based on its determination that a habeas petitioner's claim failed as a matter of constitutional law. See Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 234, 120 S. Ct. 727, 145 L. Ed. 2d 727 (2000) (posing the dispositive question "whether the Constitution requires anything more" than the jury instructions the petitioner challenged and "hold[ing] that it does not"). In the second-or-successive context as in the appealability framework, that a threshold procedural inquiry and the merits are not coextensive does not mean that they do not overlap.
Even in the Batson and Title VII examples—which, as I have explained, do not clarify what section 2244(b)(3)(C) means when it refers to "a prima facie showing"—a plaintiff's prima facie case is not independent of "the merits." If a court rejects a Batson claim because the claimant has failed to establish the requisite prima facie showing, nobody would dispute that the court has rejected that claim on the merits. See Brown v. Alexander, 543 F.3d 94, 103 (2d Cir. 2008) (applying the framework for claims "adjudicated on the merits in [s]tate court," 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), to a "decision that a prima facie case had not been made out under Batson"); Franklin v. Sims, 538 F.3d 661, 666 (7th Cir. 2008) (same). And if a court grants summary judgment against a Title VII claim because the plaintiff has failed to discharge his prima facie burden under McDonnell Douglas, nobody would dispute that that claim too has been decided on the merits. See Moron-Barradas v. Dep't of Educ. of P.R., 488 F.3d 472, 478-80 (1st  Cir. 2007) (granting preclusive effect to a Puerto Rico court's determination that a Title VII plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination). In each of these cases, any distinction between "the merits question" and "the prima facie showing alone" collapses when the plaintiff fails at step one. Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 70; see also Jackson v. United States, 875 F.3d 1089, 1091 n.4 (11th Cir. 2017) (explaining that the dismissal of a complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim is ordinarily "an adjudication on the merits").
So what remains of Judge Martin's critique after we discard the mistaken premise that merits are merits, threshold inquiries are threshold inquiries, and never the twain shall meet? Her dissent objects to eight published orders because they decided that particular offenses were crimes of violence or violent felonies, see Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 75-77, but it never explains how it is inconsistent with our gatekeeping function under section 2255(h) to deny applications based on questions of law—which we usually think it is our job to answer—and a routine examination of judicial records—which we must often wade into in any event to determine whether a motion would indeed be "second or successive." See Evans-García v. United States, 744 F.3d 235, 240 (1st Cir. 2014) ("[A] circuit court should deny certification where it is clear as a matter of law, and without the need to consider contested evidence, that the petitioner's identified constitutional rule does not apply to the petitioner's situation."); cf. S-V-, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 1309 (finding no "prima facie eligibility for withholding of removal" based on the Board's discretionary first-instance determination that the movant's robbery conviction was for a "particularly serious crime"). The dissent protests that "the heavily abridged second or successive application procedures" impair our ability to make a reasoned decision, Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 76, but it never explains why 30 days is too little time for three judges with the help of their law clerks and staff attorneys to research and decide the discrete legal issue whether a particular offense is or is not a crime of violence, an inquiry with which our Court has plenty of experience. See id. at 61 (observing that "[t]he issue of what constitutes a crime of violence . . . has been the subject of extensive consideration in this Circuit").
This Court is not the only circuit that has published orders denying prisoners' applications on the ground that Johnson could not benefit them because their predicate offenses were crimes of violence. See In re Irby, 858 F.3d 231 (4th Cir. 2017); Dawkins v. United States, 809 F.3d 953 (7th Cir. 2016). And, as long as we are on the subject of persuasive authority, several of our sister circuits have disagreed with Judge Martin's "permissive[]" notion of how the application process should work in other ways. Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 73. For example, five circuits—four not counting ours—have held that the Act permits courts of appeals to deny second or successive collateral challenges based on manifest untimeliness, at least in certain circumstances. See In re Williams, 759 F.3d 66, 68-69, 411 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (D.C. Cir. 2014); In re Vassell, 751 F.3d 267, 271 (4th Cir. 2014); In re Lewis, 484 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir. 2007); In re Hill, 437 F.3d 1080, 1083 (11th Cir. 2006); Outlaw v. Sternes, 233 F.3d 453, 455 (7th Cir. 2000); see also In re Jackson, 826 F.3d 1343, 1350 & n.8 (11th Cir. 2016) (acknowledging that a "hands-off approach" with respect to timeliness "will not suit every application" and reaffirming Hill). The First Circuit has held that it can rely on judicial records to determine that an applicant is outside the scope of a new rule. See Evans-García, 744 F.3d at 240. And the Fifth and Eighth  Circuits have held that a second or successive collateral challenge does not "contain" or "rel[y] on" a new rule when it "depends on recognition of a second new rule" that would be an extension of the first. Donnell v. United States, 826 F.3d 1014, 1016 (8th Cir. 2016); accord In re Arnick, 826 F.3d 787, 788 (5th Cir. 2016). Now is not the time to examine whether all of these decisions were correct; lest we forget, the Court today is denying rehearing en banc of a direct appeal. But it is significant that the dissent's minimalist concept of our gatekeeping function would unsettle not just our own practices but also those of many of our sister circuits.
The dissent complains that "[t]he members of this Court are bound to treat [our published orders] as binding precedent in this Circuit, unless and until the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc reverses each of them, one by one," but the same is true of all of our precedents. Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 83. Of course, Judge Martin and our other dissenting colleagues are free to disagree with the legal conclusions that panels have reached in the course of denying applications to file second or successive motions. But if they do, they would be better served by trying to persuade the rest of us to reconsider those holdings en banc, see Concurring Op. of Tjoflat, J., at 17-22, than by rehashing their position that we cannot deny the doomed applications of prisoners who cannot achieve relief, compare, e.g., Dissenting Op. of Wilson, J., at 53-57, and Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 64-84, with Ovalles v. United States, 905 F.3d 1231, 1266-73 (11th Cir. 2018) (en banc) (Martin, J., dissenting); In re Williams, 898 F.3d 1098, 1100-05 (11th Cir. 2018) (Wilson, J., specially concurring); id. at 1105-10 (Martin, J., specially concurring); In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d 1162, 1165-66 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring in result); In re Clayton, 829 F.3d 1254, 1263-67 (11th Cir. 2016) (Martin, J., concurring in result); In re McCall, 826 F.3d 1308, 1311-12 (11th Cir. 2016) (Martin, J., concurring); In re Colon, 826 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir. 2016) (Martin, J., dissenting); and Saint Fleur, 824 F.3d at 1341-44 (Martin, J., concurring).
Finally, some of the complaints in Judge Martin's dissent less reflect disagreement with our precedents than dissatisfaction with Congress's policy choices. The dissent laments that the Act gives prisoners only "one chance to collaterally attack their sentence as a matter of right" and that the chance "comes too soon" for some convicts with lengthy sentences, Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 64, but the statutory system of alternating limitations periods constitutes an integral part of Congress's orderly regulation of federal postconviction review, see 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244(d), 2255(f). The dissent charges us with abusing our "gatekeeping function" "to lock the gate and throw away the key," Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 84, but we have done no more than to execute our gatekeeping function under the Act as we have understood it at least ever since we held in Holladay that not every application that incants a new rule opens the lock. The dissent protests that "prisoners sentenced in Alabama, Florida and Georgia may be serving illegal sentences for which they have no remedy," id., but Congress has emphatically rejected an error-correction-at-all-costs model of postconviction review.
Instead, Congress has decided that collateral litigation, like all things, must eventually come to an end. And we are bound to respect that mandate.
