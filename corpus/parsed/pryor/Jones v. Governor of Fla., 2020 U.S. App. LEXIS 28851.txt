Florida has long followed the common practice of excluding those who commit serious crimes from voting. But in 2018, the people of Florida approved a historic amendment to their state constitution to restore the voting rights of thousands of convicted felons. They imposed only one condition: before regaining the right to vote, felons must complete all the terms of their criminal sentences, including imprisonment, probation, and payment of any fines, fees, costs, and restitution. We must decide whether the financial terms of that condition violate the Constitution.
Several felons sued to challenge the requirement that they pay their fines, fees, costs, and restitution before regaining the right to vote. They complained that this requirement violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to felons who cannot afford to pay the required amounts and that it imposes a tax on voting in violation of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment; that the laws governing felon reenfranchisement and voter fraud are void for vagueness; and that Florida has denied them procedural due process by adopting requirements that make it difficult for them to determine whether they are eligible to vote. The district court entered a permanent injunction that allows any felon who is unable to pay his fines or restitution or who has failed for any reason to pay his court fees and costs to register and vote. Because the felons failed to prove a violation of the Constitution, we reverse the judgment of the district court and vacate the challenged portions of its injunction.
 I. BACKGROUND
Like many other States, Florida has long prohibited convicted felons from voting. The first Constitution of Florida gave the legislature the power "to exclude . . . from the right of suffrage, all persons convicted of bribery, perjury, or other infamous crime." Fla. Const. art. VI, § 4 (1838). The legislature exercised this power to disenfranchise those convicted of an "infamous crime" shortly after the Union admitted Florida in 1845. 1845 Fla. Laws 78. And until late 2018, the Constitution of Florida provided without qualification that "[n]o person convicted of a felony . . . shall be qualified to vote or hold office until restoration of civil rights." Fla. Const. art. VI, § 4(a) (2018).
In 2018, the people of Florida amended their constitution to restore the voting rights of some felons. Amendment 4 began as a voter initiative that appeared on the general election ballot in November 2018. The amendment provides that "any disqualification from voting arising from a felony conviction shall terminate and voting rights shall be restored upon completion of all terms of sentence including parole or probation." Fla. Const. art. VI, § 4(a). It does not apply to felons convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense. Id. § 4(a)-(b). The amendment passed with about 65 percent of the vote, just over the required 60-percent threshold. See id. art. XI, § 5(e).
Shortly after Amendment 4 took effect, the Florida Legislature enacted a statute, Senate Bill 7066, to implement the amendment. This statute defined the phrase "[c]ompletion of all terms of sentence" in Amendment 4 to mean any portion of a sentence contained in the sentencing document, including imprisonment, probation, restitution, fines, fees, and costs. Fla. Stat. § 98.0751(2)(a). The Supreme Court of Florida later agreed with that interpretation and ruled that the phrase "all terms of sentence" includes all financial obligations imposed as part of a criminal sentence. Advisory Opinion to the Governor re: Implementation of Amendment 4, 288 So. 3d 1070, 1084 (Fla. 2020).
To vote in Florida, a person must submit a registration form. The form requires registrants to affirm that they are not a convicted felon or that, if they are, their right to vote has been restored. Florida does not require felons to prove that they have completed their sentences during the registration process. The State allows felons to request an advisory opinion on eligibility before registration, and any felon who registers in reliance on an opinion is immune from prosecution. If the registration form is complete and the Division of Elections determines that the registrant is a real person, it adds the person to the voter registration system. If the State later obtains "credible and reliable" information establishing that the person has a felony conviction and has not completed all the terms of his sentence, the person is subject to removal from the voter rolls. See Fla. Stat. § 98.075(5). But any such felon is considered a registered voter, and before removal from the voter registration system, he is entitled to notice—including "a copy of any documentation upon which [his] potential ineligibility is based"—and a hearing, as well as de novo judicial review of an adverse eligibility determination. Id. §§ 98.075(7), 98.0755.
At the time of trial, Florida had received 85,000 registrations from felons who believe they were reenfranchised by Amendment 4. State law requires that those registrations be screened for, among other things, the voters' failure to complete the terms of their sentences including financial obligations. Id. § 98.0751. Florida has yet to complete its screening of any of the registrations. Until it does, it will not have credible and reliable information supporting anyone's removal from the voter rolls, and all 85,000 felons will be entitled to vote. See id. §§ 98.075(5) and (7).
Several felons sued Florida officials to challenge the requirement that they pay their fines, fees, costs, and restitution before regaining the right to vote. Among other provisions, they alleged that the reenfranchisement laws violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.
The district court entered a preliminary injunction in favor of the felons because it concluded they were likely to succeed on their claim under the Equal Protection Clause. It ruled that requiring felons to complete all financial terms of their sentences before regaining the right to vote was unconstitutional wealth discrimination as applied to felons unable to pay the required amounts. The preliminary injunction ordered the officials not to prevent the plaintiff felons from registering or voting based solely on their inability to pay any outstanding financial obligations in their sentences.
A panel of this Court affirmed the preliminary injunction on interlocutory appeal. Jones v. Governor of Fla., 950 F.3d 795, 800 (11th Cir. 2020). The panel held that the decision to condition reenfranchisement on the completion of "all terms of sentence" violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to indigent felons who cannot afford to pay their fines, fees, costs, and restitution. Id. It reached this conclusion by applying heightened scrutiny on the ground that Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 discriminate on the basis of wealth. Id. at 817. It also suggested in dicta that the laws may fail even rational basis review. Id. at 809, 817.
The district court certified a class and a subclass of felons for purposes of final injunctive and declaratory relief. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The class comprises "all persons who would be eligible to vote in Florida but for unpaid financial obligations." The subclass comprises "all persons who would be eligible to vote in Florida but for unpaid financial obligations that the person asserts the person is genuinely unable to pay."
Before trial, the State adopted what the district court called the "every-dollar method" for determining when felons complete their financial terms of sentence. Under this policy, the State credits all payments a felon makes for any obligations related to his sentence toward the original obligations imposed in the sentence. For example, if a felon establishes a payment plan to complete his terms of sentence, any payments the felon makes for setting up or administering the plan also count toward the original financial obligations imposed in the sentence. After a felon has paid an amount equal to that imposed in his sentence, the State considers the felon's financial terms of sentence complete for purposes of reenfranchisement.
After a trial on the merits, the district court ruled that Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 violate the Equal Protection Clause as applied to felons who cannot afford to complete their sentences. It applied heightened scrutiny to reach that conclusion based on the panel decision in the earlier appeal, and it alternatively ruled that the laws failed even rational basis review as applied to felons who are unable to pay the required amounts. The district court also ruled that Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 impose a "tax" on voting by requiring felons to pay court fees and costs imposed in their sentences in violation of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.
The district court did not decide whether Florida's reenfranchisement laws violate the Due Process Clause. It stated that there was "considerable force" to the arguments that the relevant laws are void for vagueness and deny the felons procedural due process. It found that felons are sometimes unable to determine the amount of financial obligations imposed in their sentences or the total amount they have paid toward all related obligations. The amount of financial obligations imposed in a sentence is usually clear from the judgment, which can be obtained from the county of conviction. But many felons no longer have copies of their judgments, and some counties may lack records for older convictions. When judgments contain both misdemeanor and felony offenses, it may not be immediately clear whether all financial obligations were imposed only for a disqualifying felony offense. The district court did not decide whether these facts established a violation of the Due Process Clause, but it stated that its remedy for the other constitutional violations would eliminate any due process concerns.
The district court awarded declaratory and injunctive relief. It declared Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 unconstitutional insofar as they prohibit otherwise-eligible felons who are "genuinely unable to pay" their financial obligations from voting, require felons to pay "amounts that are unknown and cannot be determined with diligence" to regain their voting rights, and require any felons "to pay fees and costs as a condition of voting." It enjoined any defendant from taking steps to enforce those requirements. But it did not enjoin the requirement that felons pay "a determinable amount of fines and restitution as a condition of voting" if they can afford to do so.
The district court also imposed new procedures to govern the registration and voting process for felons. Its injunction required the Secretary of State to publish a form to request an advisory opinion from the Division of Elections regarding the existence and amount of any outstanding fines or restitution that could render a felon ineligible to vote. The form allowed requesters to check a box that stated, "I believe I am unable to pay the required amount." If the Division failed to respond to a request within 21 days and if the requester checked the box, the injunction required that the requester be allowed to vote.
The Governor and the Secretary of State appealed. They petitioned this Court for initial hearing en banc and moved to stay most aspects of the permanent injunction pending appeal. We granted both requests.
 II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
We review the decision to enter a permanent injunction for an abuse of discretion, but we review the underlying legal conclusions de novo and any factual findings for clear error. See Common Cause/Ga. v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1349 (11th Cir. 2009).
 III. DISCUSSION
We divide our discussion in three parts. We first explain that Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 do not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Next, we explain why the laws do not impose a tax on voting in violation of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. Finally, we reject the arguments that the challenged laws are void for vagueness and that Florida has denied the felons due process.
 A. Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 Do Not Violate the Equal Protection Clause.
The practice of disenfranchising persons who commit serious crimes has a long history that predates the founding of the Republic. George Brooks, Comment, Felon Disenfranchisement: Law, History, Policy, and Politics, 32 Fordham Urb. L.J. 851, 852-53 (2005). As Judge Friendly explained, early American States may have based the practice on the Lockean understanding that those who break the social contract by committing a crime "have abandoned the right to participate in further administering the compact." Green v. Bd. of Elections, 380 F.2d 445, 451 (2d Cir. 1967). And as a practical matter, "it can scarcely be deemed unreasonable for a state to decide that perpetrators of serious crimes shall not take part in electing the legislators who make the laws, the executives who enforce these, the prosecutors who must try them for further violations, or the judges who are to consider their cases." Id.
When the States ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, 29 of their constitutions permitted or required felon disenfranchisement. Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24, 48, 94 S. Ct. 2655, 41 L. Ed. 2d 551 & n.14 (1974). Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment expressly allows States to disenfranchise criminals without having their representation reduced in Congress. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2. Today, almost all States disenfranchise felons in some way, although the recent trend is toward expanding access to the franchise. Jones, 950 F.3d at 801 & nn.1-3.
Based on the express provision for felon disenfranchisement in section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court held in Richardson v. Ramirez that the Equal Protection Clause in section 1 of the same amendment does not forbid the practice. 418 U.S. at 54-56. The Court held that the Equal Protection Clause permits States to disenfranchise all felons for life, even after they have completed their sentences. Id. at 56. Florida largely followed this practice before the adoption of Amendment 4. It presumptively disenfranchised felons for life upon conviction, subject only to discretionary restoration of voting rights by executive clemency. Jones, 950 F.3d at 802.
This appeal requires us to consider what limits the Equal Protection Clause places on the selective restoration of felons' voting rights. By conditioning reenfranchisement on the completion of all terms of sentence, Florida has decided to restore some felons to the franchise but not others. The felons challenge the classification Florida has drawn between felons who have completed all their terms of sentence, including financial terms, and those who have not. They argue that this classification violates the Equal Protection Clause as applied to felons who have completed all other terms of sentence but cannot afford to pay their fines, fees, costs, and restitution.
Under the Equal Protection Clause, classifications that neither implicate fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines are subject to rational basis review. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe ex rel. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319-20, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1993). Whatever may be true of the right to vote generally, felons "cannot complain about their loss of a fundamental right to vote because felon disenfranchisement is explicitly permitted under the terms of Richardson." Harvey v. Brewer, 605 F.3d 1067, 1079 (9th Cir. 2010) (O'Connor, J.); accord Johnson v. Bredesen, 624 F.3d 742, 746 (6th Cir. 2010); Hayden v. Paterson, 594 F.3d 150, 170 (2d Cir. 2010); Owens v. Barnes, 711 F.2d 25, 27 (3d Cir. 1983). If the right of felons to vote were fundamental, every law that distinguished between different groups of felons in granting or denying access to the franchise would be subject to "exacting judicial scrutiny." Kramer v. Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 15, 395 U.S. 621, 628, 89 S. Ct. 1886, 23 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1969). But the Constitution does not put States to an all-or-nothing choice when it comes to deciding whether felons may vote. As our predecessor Court held decades ago, the Constitution "grants to the states a realm of discretion in the disenfranchisement and reenfranchisement of felons which the states do not possess with respect to limiting the franchise of other citizens." Shepherd v. Trevino, 575 F.2d 1110, 1114 (5th Cir. 1978).
States may restrict voting by felons in ways that would be impermissible for other citizens. For example, no one doubts that a State could not require citizens never convicted of a crime to serve a term of confinement or supervision to access the franchise. Such a requirement would have "no relation to voting qualifications" and so would be invalid under the Equal Protection Clause. Harper v. Va. Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670, 86 S. Ct. 1079, 16 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1966). But States may unquestionably require felons to complete their terms of imprisonment and parole before regaining the right to vote. See Richardson, 418 U.S. at 55-56; Hayden, 594 F.3d at 171. The reason for this difference is clear: requiring felons to complete their sentences is directly related to voting qualifications because imprisonment and parole are imposed as punishment for the crimes by which felons forfeited their right to vote.
Although States enjoy significant discretion in distributing the franchise to felons, it is not unfettered. A State may not rely on suspect classifications in this area any more than in other areas of legislation. But absent a suspect classification that independently warrants heightened scrutiny, laws that govern felon disenfranchisement and reenfranchisement are subject to rational basis review. Shepherd, 575 F.2d at 1114-15. Every other Circuit to consider the question has reached the same conclusion. See Johnson, 624 F.3d at 746; Harvey, 605 F.3d at 1079; Hayden, 594 F.3d at 170; Owens, 711 F.2d at 27. Were the rule otherwise, the "realm of discretion" States enjoy in this area would prove illusory. Shepherd, 575 F.2d at 1114.
The only classification at issue is between felons who have completed all terms of their sentences, including financial terms, and those who have not. This classification does not turn on membership in a suspect class: the requirement that felons complete their sentences applies regardless of race, religion, or national origin. Because this classification is not suspect, we review it for a rational basis only.
In the earlier appeal from the preliminary injunction, the panel elided this analysis and applied "some form of heightened scrutiny" on the ground that Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 invidiously discriminate based on wealth. Jones, 950 F.3d at 817. That decision was wrong. To reiterate, Florida withholds the franchise from any felon, regardless of wealth, who has failed to complete any term of his criminal sentence—financial or otherwise. It does not single out the failure to complete financial terms for special treatment. And in any event, wealth is not a suspect classification. See, e.g., Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 470-71, 97 S. Ct. 2376, 53 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1977). Outside of narrow circumstances, laws that burden the indigent are subject only to rational basis review. See M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 123-24, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996).
To justify its application of heightened scrutiny, the panel relied on Supreme Court precedents governing poll taxes, Harper, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S. Ct. 1079, 16 L. Ed. 2d 169; poverty-based imprisonment, e.g., Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983); and access to judicial proceedings, e.g., Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S. Ct. 585, 100 L. Ed. 891 (1956). The felons ask us to affirm the permanent injunction based on these same decisions. But none of these precedents, alone or in combination, requires heightened scrutiny for the decision to condition reenfranchisement on the full completion of a criminal sentence.
Consider first Harper, which invalidated a $1.50 poll tax under the Equal Protection Clause. This poll tax applied to the Virginia electorate generally; any voter who wished to cast a ballot in a state election had to pay the tax. Harper, 383 U.S. at 664 n.1. Although States have the power to set voter qualifications, the Court explained that the Equal Protection Clause "restrains the States from fixing voter qualifications which invidiously discriminate." Id. at 666. Because poll taxes bear "no relation" to voter qualifications, the Court concluded that Virginia had "introduce[d] a capricious or irrelevant factor" by requiring voters to pay the tax. Id. at 666, 668. Under Harper, it is a per se violation of the Equal Protection Clause for a State to "make[] the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard." Id. at 666.
Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 are markedly different from the poll tax in Harper. They do not make affluence or the payment of a fee an "electoral standard." Id. They instead impose a different electoral standard: to regain the right to vote, felons, rich and poor, must complete all terms of their criminal sentences. Unlike the poll tax in Harper, that requirement is highly relevant to voter qualifications. See Richardson, 418 U.S. at 55; Hayden, 594 F.3d at 171. It promotes full rehabilitation of returning citizens and ensures full satisfaction of the punishment imposed for the crimes by which felons forfeited the right to vote. That criminal sentences often include financial obligations does not make this requirement a "capricious or irrelevant factor." Harper, 383 U.S. at 668. Monetary provisions of a sentence are no less a part of the penalty that society imposes for a crime than terms of imprisonment. Indeed, some felons face substantial monetary penalties but little or no prison time.
Because the financial obligations at issue are directly related to legitimate voter qualifications, Harper is inapplicable. The en banc Ninth Circuit rejected a similar request to apply Harper to valid voter qualifications that impose a financial burden on some voters. It held that "[r]equiring voters to provide documents proving their identity is not an invidious classification based on impermissible standards of wealth or affluence, even if some individuals have to pay to obtain the documents." Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 409 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc) (emphasis added), aff'd sub nom. Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Az., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 133 S. Ct. 2247, 186 L. Ed. 2d 239 (2013). Like requiring voters to prove their identity, requiring felons to complete their full criminal sentences "falls squarely within the state's power to fix core voter qualifications." Id. The felons' contrary reading of Harper would call into question any law that made voting more expensive for some people than others, even if the additional cost were directly tied to valid voter qualifications.
Harper also proves too much to help the felons, which is further evidence that it does not apply. Harper held that the Virginia poll tax was unconstitutional regardless of whether a voter could pay the tax; it did not matter whether a voter "ha[d] $1.50 in his pocket or nothing at all, pa[id] the fee or fail[ed] to pay it." 383 U.S. at 668. But no one doubts that the Equal Protection Clause allows Florida to require felons who are able to complete the financial terms of their sentences to do so. If completing the financial terms of a sentence were truly "irrelevant" to voter qualifications, id., Florida could not require any felons to satisfy that requirement as a condition of voting. The watered-down version of Harper that the felons would have us apply ignores the crucial distinction between poll taxes and Florida's reenfranchisement law: poll taxes are never relevant to voter qualifications, but laws that require the completion of a criminal sentence are. See Richardson, 418 U.S. at 55. The per se rule of Harper does not apply to voting requirements that are related to legitimate voter qualifications, even if some voters must pay to comply with the requirement. See Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 409; Crawford v. Marion Cnty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 189, 128 S. Ct. 1610, 170 L. Ed. 2d 574 (2008) (plurality opinion) (explaining that Harper invalidates voting restrictions that "are unrelated to voter qualifications"); cf. Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U.S. 701, 702-04, 89 S. Ct. 1897, 23 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1969) (asking whether a law that gave only property taxpayers the right to vote in certain elections was necessary to serve a compelling state interest but not applying the per se rule of Harper).
In addition to Harper, the panel in the earlier appeal relied on two other lines of Supreme Court precedent to apply heightened scrutiny. Jones, 950 F.3d at 817-19. These decisions represent limited exceptions to the general rule that rational basis review applies to claims of wealth discrimination. See M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 123-24. They do not apply here.
The first line of precedent, which culminated in the Bearden decision, applies when the State imprisons a person by reason of his inability to pay a fine. Bearden, 461 U.S. at 667-69; see also Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 396-98, 91 S. Ct. 668, 28 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1971); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 240-41, 90 S. Ct. 2018, 26 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1970). Williams, Tate, and Bearden all involved criminal defendants whose sentences included fines or restitution. Bearden, 461 U.S. at 662-63, 667. In each decision, the defendant was unable to pay the required amount solely because of poverty, which led the State to impose an additional term of imprisonment on the defendant that was not part of his original sentence. Id. The Court explained in Bearden that "if the State determines a fine or restitution to be the appropriate and adequate penalty for the crime, it may not thereafter imprison a person solely because he lacked the resources to pay it." Id. at 667-68. But because Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 do not impose an additional term of imprisonment on felons who fail to pay their financial obligations, they are far afield of the laws that Bearden and its predecessors considered.
The earlier panel erroneously read these decisions to stand for the proposition that "a state may not extend punishment"—that is, disenfranchisement—"on account of inability to pay fines or fees." Jones, 950 F.3d at 818 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has never extended Bearden beyond the context of poverty-based imprisonment. See Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 461 n.*, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1988) (declining to extend Bearden). And Williams, the foundational decision in this line of precedent, stated that nothing in its holding "limit[ed] the power of the [State] to impose alternative sanctions" besides imprisonment on defendants who cannot satisfy the monetary terms of their sentences. 399 U.S. at 245; accord Bearden, 461 U.S. at 671-72.
But even if Bearden applied beyond poverty-based imprisonment, it would not help the felons for a more fundamental reason. Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 do not impose additional punishment because of a felon's failure to pay his fines, fees, costs, and restitution. Florida automatically disenfranchises all felons upon conviction, and the challenged laws only lift that punishment for felons who have completed all terms of their sentences. This case would resemble Bearden if Florida left the right to vote intact upon conviction but then revoked the franchise from any felons who could not pay their fines and restitution. In that scenario, the State would have determined that its "penological interests do not require" disenfranchisement, which would call into doubt the decision to impose disenfranchisement solely because of a felon's inability to pay fines and restitution. Bearden, 461 U.S. at 670. But Florida does nothing of the kind.
The Supreme Court has also applied heightened scrutiny to laws that condition access to certain judicial proceedings on the ability to pay. See M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 110-16 (tracing the development of this exception to Griffin, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S. Ct. 585, 100 L. Ed. 891). But this exception to rational basis review applies only when the State makes "access to judicial processes in cases criminal or quasi criminal in nature turn on ability to pay." Id. at 124 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And even when the Supreme Court has extended the right of access to the courts to other kinds of judicial proceedings, it has "felt compelled to justify even . . . slight extension[s] of the right." Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 354, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996). The extension the felons seek is hardly "slight"—the challenged laws do not concern access to judicial proceedings at all. The access-to-courts precedents are wholly inapposite.
The felons resist the conclusion that the Bearden and Griffin lines of precedent are limited to the contexts in which they arose, but they identify no decisions that invoke Bearden or Griffin to apply heightened scrutiny to a claim of wealth discrimination outside those contexts. And the dissenters' contention that "the Supreme Court applied Griffin to the voting context in Harper," Jordan Dissent at 119, is plainly inaccurate. Far from "rel[ying] on Griffin to invalidate . . . Virginia['s] poll tax," id., Harper cited Griffin once in passing to support the proposition that "[l]ines drawn on the basis of wealth or property . . . are traditionally disfavored," Harper, 383 U.S. at 668 (citing Griffin, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S. Ct. 585, 100 L. Ed. 891). The Court did not provide even a pinpoint citation to any passage in Griffin, much less analysis extending it to the context of voting. Id. The Supreme Court has made clear that heightened scrutiny for claims of wealth discrimination is the exception, not the rule. M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 123-24. Unable to fit their claim into any existing exception, the felons rely on "nothing more than an amalgamation" of multiple theories, each of which lacks merit on its own. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. Linkline Commc'ns, Inc., 555 U.S. 438, 452, 129 S. Ct. 1109, 172 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2009).
We hold that rational basis review applies and overrule the contrary holding by the panel in the earlier appeal from the preliminary injunction. Jones, 950 F.3d at 800. Stare decisis does not counsel that we should adhere to that earlier decision. See McCarthan v. Dir. of Goodwill Indus.-Suncoast, Inc., 851 F.3d 1076, 1096 (11th Cir. 2017) (en banc). The doctrine of stare decisis "is at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution." Ramos v. Louisiana, 140 S. Ct. 1390, 1405, 206 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the panel interpreted the Constitution and not a statute, only we or the Supreme Court can correct its "gravely mistaken" reasoning. Id. That earlier decision is inconsistent with clear Supreme Court precedent and every relevant decision of our sister circuits—indeed, it is, to our knowledge, the only appellate decision ever to apply heightened scrutiny to felon reenfranchisement in the absence of any suspect classification. See id. (considering "consistency with related decisions"). And any reliance interests on that decision—which affirmed a preliminary injunction entered earlier this year in this very litigation—are weak. See Franchise Tax Bd. v. Hyatt, 139 S. Ct. 1485, 1499, 203 L. Ed. 2d 768 (2019) (rejecting "case-specific costs" as a reliance interest that can justify adhering to "an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question").
A classification survives rational basis review if it is rationally related to some legitimate government interest, Heller, 509 U.S. at 320, and two interests are relevant here. Florida unquestionably has an interest in disenfranchising convicted felons, even those who have completed their sentences. See Richardson, 418 U.S. at 56. But Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 also reflect a different, related interest. They advance Florida's interest in restoring felons to the electorate after justice has been done and they have been fully rehabilitated by the criminal justice system. The policy Florida has adopted reflects the "more modern view" described in Richardson that "it is essential to the process of rehabilitating the ex-felon that he be returned to his role in society as a fully participating citizen when he has completed the serving of his term." Id. at 55. The twin interests in disenfranchising those who disregard the law and restoring those who satisfy the demands of justice are both legitimate goals for a State to advance. See id. at 55-56. The question is whether the classification Florida has adopted between felons who have completed their full sentences and those who have not is rationally related to those interests.
The dissenters suggest that Florida's only possible interests are in punishment and debt collection, Jordan Dissent at 145-49, and that narrow view leads them to conclude that Senate Bill 7066 is irrational, id. at 149. The dissenters dismiss our view that Florida also has an interest in restoring rehabilitated felons to the electorate as "an ipse dixit . . . [that] merely restates what the law does." Id. at 141. But it is not unusual for a policy to directly achieve an objective itself. See Adams ex. rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 968 F.3d 1286,     (11th Cir. 2020) (W. Pryor, C.J., dissenting). And we do not think it is unnatural to find state interests broader than punishment and revenue-raising in a reenfranchisement law.
In deciding whether Florida's classification is rational, we are mindful that our review is extremely narrow. See FCC v. Beach Commc'ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 314, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211 (1993) ("This standard of review is a paradigm of judicial restraint."). We must uphold the classification unless the felons "negative every conceivable basis which might support it." Id. at 315 (internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, the Supreme Court "hardly ever strikes down a policy as illegitimate under rational basis scrutiny." Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2420, 201 L. Ed. 2d 775 (2018). In the rare instances when it has done so, "a common thread has been that the laws at issue lack any purpose other than a 'bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group.'" Id. (alteration adopted) (quoting U.S. Dep't of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534, 93 S. Ct. 2821, 37 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1973)); see also Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 134 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1996); City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 446-47, 450, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). There is no evidence that any kind of animus toward indigent felons motivated Florida voters and legislators to condition reenfranchisement on the completion of all terms of sentence. After all, the voters of Florida made it easier for the vast majority of felons—who are disproportionately indigent—to regain their voting rights. So we must uphold their choice if there is any conceivable basis that could justify it. See Heller, 509 U.S. at 319 ("[R]ational-basis review . . . is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices." (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Under this deferential standard, we readily conclude that Florida's classification survives scrutiny. The people of Florida could rationally conclude that felons who have completed all terms of their sentences, including paying their fines, fees, costs, and restitution, are more likely to responsibly exercise the franchise than those who have not. See Green, 380 F.2d at 451. If a State may decide that those who commit serious crimes are presumptively unfit for the franchise, id., it may also conclude that those who have completed their sentences are the best candidates for reenfranchisement.
To be sure, the line Florida drew might be imperfect. The classification may exclude some felons who would responsibly exercise the franchise and include others who are arguably less deserving. But Florida was not required "to draw the perfect line nor even to draw a line superior to some other line it might have drawn." Armour v. City of Indianapolis, 566 U.S. 673, 685, 132 S. Ct. 2073, 182 L. Ed. 2d 998 (2012). The Constitution requires only "a rational line." Id. The line between felons who have completed their sentences and those who have not easily satisfies that low bar.
The classification is rational for other reasons too. Before extending the franchise to even more felons, Florida may have wished to test the waters by reenfranchising only those who complete their full sentences. Under rational basis review, "reform may take one step at a time." Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S. Ct. 461, 99 L. Ed. 563 (1955). The State need not "strike at all evils at the same time or in the same way," Semler v. Or. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs, 294 U.S. 608, 610, 55 S. Ct. 570, 79 L. Ed. 1086 (1935), and "[a] statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did," Roschen v. Ward, 279 U.S. 337, 339, 49 S. Ct. 336, 73 L. Ed. 722 (1929). Although "every reform that benefits some more than others may be criticized for what it fails to accomplish," that reality does not invalidate the measure under the Equal Protection Clause. San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 39, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973).
Confusion about Florida's voter registration system and the record before the district court leads the dissenters to conclude that Senate Bill 7066 "does not 'rationally' further the goal of re-enfranchising felons," a goal the dissent acknowledges only "[f]or the sake of argument." Jordan Dissent at 141, 143. The dissenters purport to prove that conclusion with a smoking gun: "the fact that Florida had restored voting rights to 0 felons as of the time of trial." Id. at 143. But that "fact" is not true. Once a felon submits a facially complete registration form and Florida determines that he is a real person, he is added to the voting rolls as a registered voter; he is not then required to prove that he has completed his sentence. To be sure, Florida attempts to identify "registered voters" with felony convictions whose rights have not been restored and, after securing "credible and reliable" information, initiates the process of removing them from the voter registration system. Fla. Stat. §§ 98.075(5) and (7); see also id. at § 98.0751(3) (governing administration of § 98.075(5) in the light of Amendment 4). But at the time of trial, 85,000 felons had submitted facially complete voter registration forms, and Florida had not yet been able to find information justifying the removal of any of them from the voting rolls. Until it does, all 85,000 are entitled to vote. The dissenters' contention that state officials' implementation of Amendment 4 has prevented any felons from benefitting from the amendment is false. Eighty-five thousand felons are now registered voters, and each one will remain so unless Florida meets its self-imposed burden of gathering the information necessary to prove his ineligibility. Our dissenting colleagues quibble with our assertion that all of these registered voters are "entitled to vote," see Jordan Dissent at 144; Martin Dissent at 94 n.3, but they point to no evidence that any of the 85,000 voters will be unable to cast a ballot in an upcoming election.
The felons argue that Florida rendered its classification irrational by adopting the "every dollar" method for determining when a sentence is complete, but this argument misunderstands rational basis review. If the relationship between a State's interest and its means of achieving it is "at least debatable," then it survives scrutiny. Gary v. City of Warner Robins, 311 F.3d 1334, 1339 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 154, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234 (1938)). The "every dollar" policy is at least arguably related to Florida's interest in reenfranchising only those felons who have paid their debt to society and been fully rehabilitated. It ensures that no felons will be reenfranchised unless they have paid amounts equal to those imposed in their criminal sentences. Florida could rationally define "completion" of a sentence in this manner to help ensure that felons who enrolled in payment plans pay no more to complete their sentences than felons who paid their fines, fees, costs, and restitution immediately.
The reasoning of the district court and the panel in the earlier appeal bore no resemblance to rational basis review. Their first error was to assess the rationality of Florida's classification by asking only whether it was rational to prohibit these plaintiffs from voting. See Jones, 950 F.3d at 813 ("Florida's continued disenfranchisement of these seventeen plaintiffs is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental interest." (emphasis added)); Jones v. DeSantis,     F. Supp. 3d    ,    , 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90729, 2020 WL 2618062, at *15 (N.D. Fla. 2020) (claiming that a proper approach to rational-basis scrutiny allows a court to "consider[] the rationality of a statute as applied to particular plaintiffs without opining on its rationality more generally." (quoting Jones, 950 F.3d at 814)).A legislative classification "may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence." Beach Commc'ns, 508 U.S. at 315. For that reason, a law may be rational "even if in a particular case [it] appears to discriminate irrationally." In re Wood, 866 F.2d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir. 1989); see also Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F.2d 788, 808 n.20 (9th Cir. 1980) (Kennedy, J.) ("Nearly any statute which classifies people may be irrational as applied in particular cases.").
The dissenters repeat the error of the district court and the panel in the earlier appeal. And they accuse us of ignoring the Supreme Court's decision in City of Cleburne, see Jordan Dissent at 135-36, which they describe as applying rational-basis review to affirm a judgment "insofar as it [held an] ordinance invalid as applied in this case," City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448. But applying rational-basis review in a "case" is not the same as applying it to the unique circumstances of a specific plaintiff. After the passage cited by the dissenters, the Supreme Court in City of Cleburne evaluated whether the city's proffered reasons for requiring a permit for a group home of people with intellectual disabilities but not for comparable facilities rationally reflected relevant differences between "the mentally retarded as a group" and others. Id. at 448-50 (emphasis added). The Court did not focus on factors unique to the particular disabled people involved in the appeal—City of Cleburne does not justify the dissenters' narrow focus on whether Florida's classification applies rationally to the particular plaintiffs in this appeal.
The second error of the district court and the panel in the earlier appeal was to assume that the law would be rational if most felons could eventually pay their fines, fees, costs, and restitution but irrational if a substantial number could not. See Jones, 950 F.3d at 814. The proportion of felons who can eventually complete their sentences has no bearing on whether it is rational to conclude that felons who do complete their sentences—whatever their number—are generally more deserving of reenfranchisement than those who do not. The district court and the panel in the earlier appeal reached a contrary conclusion only by disregarding settled law. See Beach Commc'ns, 508 U.S. at 315; United States v. Castillo, 899 F.3d 1208, 1213 (11th Cir. 2018). The dissenters echo that flawed reasoning when they contend that any law that would leave a substantial portion of felons unable to benefit from Amendment 4 is "a nullification of the will of the electorate." Jill Pryor Dissent at 200. But the face of the amendment makes clear that Florida voters do not share the dissenters' view that it is unjust to tell some criminals that they have incurred debts to society that will never be repaid. See Fla. Const. art. VI, § 4(b) (denying automatic reenfranchisement to felony sex offenders and murderers). In fact, it is the dissenters who would nullify the will of the Florida electorate by reenfranchising felons whom voters clearly would not have expected to benefit from Amendment 4, including a named plaintiff who jointly owes $ 59 million in restitution for conspiracy to commit insurance and wire fraud. Florida's voters intended only to reenfranchise felons who have been fully rehabilitated, and Senate Bill 7066 drew a rational line in pursuit of that goal.
 B. Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 Do Not Violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.
Ratified in 1964, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the Constitution forbids taxes on voting in federal elections:
The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.
U.S. Const. amend. XXIV, § 1. The felons argue that Florida has denied them the right to vote by reason of their failure to pay court fees and costs imposed in their criminal sentences, which they contend are an "other tax" under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. They do not argue that fines and restitution are taxes, and for good reason. Fines, which are paid to the government as punishment for a crime, and restitution, which compensates victims of crime, are not taxes under any fair reading of that term.
The felons' argument presents two questions: first, whether fees and costs imposed in a criminal sentence are taxes under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment; and second, if fees and costs are taxes, whether Florida has denied the right to vote "by reason of" the failure to pay fees and costs.
1. Court Costs and Fees Are Not Taxes.
The term "tax" is a broad one, but it does not cover all monetary exactions imposed by the government. The Supreme Court has long distinguished taxes from penalties in a variety of contexts. See, e.g., United States v. Constantine, 296 U.S. 287, 293-94, 56 S. Ct. 223, 80 L. Ed. 233 (1935); United States v. La Franca, 282 U.S. 568, 572, 51 S. Ct. 278, 75 L. Ed. 551 (1931). This distinction was well established when the Twenty-Fourth Amendment was adopted, and it continues to define the outer limits of the term "tax" today. See Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 563, 567-70, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 183 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2012) (holding, under the canon of constitutional avoidance, that a federal law levied a tax because it could reasonably be read not to impose a penalty). In short, if a government exaction is a penalty, it is not a tax.
"The difference between a tax and a penalty is sometimes difficult to define," Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U.S. 20, 38, 42 S. Ct. 449, 66 L. Ed. 817, 1922-2 C.B. 337, T.D. 3346 (1922), but at least one principle is clear. The Supreme Court has explained in multiple contexts that "if the concept of penalty means anything, it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission." Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at 567 (quoting United States v. Reorganized CF & I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U.S. 213, 224, 116 S. Ct. 2106, 135 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1996)); see also La Franca, 282 U.S. at 572. Court fees and costs imposed in a criminal sentence fall within this definition: they are part of the State's punishment for a crime. They are not taxes.
Several features of the costs and fees at issue make clear that they are punishment for criminal wrongdoing. Most importantly, they are part of a defendant's criminal sentence—"the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer." Sentence, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). Florida caselaw holds that the costs of prosecution are criminal punishment for purposes of double jeopardy; they cannot be increased after a defendant begins serving his sentence. Martinez v. State, 91 So. 3d 878, 879-80 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2012). And if a felon cannot pay a financial obligation imposed in his sentence, the sentencing court may "convert the statutory financial obligation into a court-ordered obligation to perform community service," Fla. Stat. § 938.30(2), a provision that makes little sense if costs and fees exist primarily to raise revenue and not to punish and rehabilitate offenders.
Like fines and restitution, fees and costs are also linked to culpability. Florida imposes heftier costs on felony offenders than those convicted of misdemeanors or criminal traffic offenses, and it does not impose any fees and costs if a criminal case ends in an acquittal or a nolle prosequi. See id. §§ 938.05(1), 939.06(1). Florida imposes fees and costs only on those who are convicted of a crime or who have their adjudication of guilt withheld, a process that allows the court to suspend the imposition of sentence if it determines "that the defendant is not likely again to engage in a criminal course of conduct and that the ends of justice and the welfare of society do not require that the defendant presently suffer the penalty imposed by law." Id. § 948.01(2). But even felony defendants who have their adjudication of guilt withheld are subject to the punitive and rehabilitative powers of the sentencing court: they must complete a term of probation and may have to pay both fines and costs. See State v. Tribble, 984 So. 2d 639, 640-41 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008); Clinger v. State, 533 So. 2d 315, 316-17 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988). The punitive nature of fees and costs is no less applicable to defendants who plead nolo contendere because that plea, like a guilty plea, results in a conviction and "gives the court the power to punish." Vinson v. State, 345 So. 2d 711, 715 (Fla. 1977).
The Supreme Court has relied on similar features to conclude that exactions that bore a far greater resemblance to taxes than court costs do were in fact penalties. For example, the Court held that a "so-called tax" on the possession of illegal drugs was in reality criminal punishment in part because the exaction was "conditioned on the commission of a crime." Dep't of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767, 781, 114 S. Ct. 1937, 128 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1994); see also Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at 566 (relying on Kurth Ranch to distinguish taxes from penalties). "That condition," the Court explained, was "significant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gathering of revenue." Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. at 781 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court relied on similar reasoning to hold that a $ 1,000 excise imposed only on those who violated state liquor laws was a penalty, not a tax. Constantine, 296 U.S. at 295.
The functional analysis used in National Federation of Independent Business supports our conclusion that the fees and costs in this appeal are penalties, not taxes. The Court explained that exactions imposed only on those who knowingly violate the law are suggestive of a penalty, not a tax. 567 U.S. at 565-66. The Court also stressed that using a "criminal prosecution" to collect an exaction is "suggestive of a punitive sanction." Id. at 566. And the Court reasoned that an exaction is likely a tax when the behavior to which it applies is lawful. Id. at 568 ("Neither the Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. . . . [I]f someone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insurance, they have fully complied with the law."). Here, by contrast, fees and costs are imposed only on those who, following criminal prosecution for their unlawful acts, are subject to the punitive and rehabilitative powers of a Florida court. The characteristic features of penalties that the Court noted were absent in National Federation of Independent Business are present here.
To be sure, one purpose of fees and costs is to raise revenue, but that does not transform them from criminal punishment into a tax. Every financial penalty raises revenue for the government, sometimes considerable revenue. In addition to costs and fees, Florida uses criminal fines to fund both its courts and general government operations, but that additional purpose does not make them taxes. See Fla. Stat. § 142.01(1) (establishing the "fine and forfeiture fund" for use "in performing court-related functions"); id. § 775.083(1) (directing that criminal fines be deposited in the fine and forfeiture fund); id. § 316.193(2)(a) (directing the clerk to remit portions of fines for driving under the influence "to the Department of Revenue for deposit into the General Revenue Fund"). Nor does the fact that many fees and costs do not vary based on the severity of the offense render them nonpunitive. Some punishments, like disenfranchisement, are imposed on all felons alike regardless of the severity of their crimes. Because court costs and fees are legitimate parts of a criminal sentence—that is, part of the debt to society that felons must pay for their crimes—there is no basis to regard them as a tax. We hold that fees and costs imposed in a criminal sentence are not taxes under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, and we reject the felons' Twenty-Fourth Amendment argument on that basis.
2. Florida Does Not Deny the Right to Vote "by Reason of" Failure to Pay a Tax.
Even if fees and costs were taxes, the felons' reliance on the Twenty-Fourth Amendment would be misplaced. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment provides that "[t]he right . . . to vote . . . shall not be denied or abridged . . . by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax." U.S. Const. amend. XXIV, § 1. A financial obligation that indirectly burdens the right to vote is permissible under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment when the State has a constitutionally legitimate reason for imposing the voter qualification that creates the indirect burden. But before explaining why, it is necessary to address—and reject—an argument that the State makes.
In addition to its argument that fees and costs are not taxes, the State contends that the Twenty-Fourth Amendment "does not apply when the right to vote has been constitutionally forfeited." Quoting the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Harvey v. Brewer, the State contends that because disenfranchised felons have "lost their right to vote, they . . . have no cognizable Twenty-Fourth Amendment claim until their voting rights are restored." 605 F.3d at 1080; see also Johnson, 624 F.3d at 751. The State maintains that Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 provide only "requirements for reenfranchisement," which the Twenty-Fourth Amendment does not govern.
The implication of that logic for the other voting-rights amendments shows why the State's argument is plainly wrong. If the voting-rights amendments protect only those with a pre-existing right to vote and do not apply to so-called "reenfranchisement laws," then a State would not violate the Fifteenth Amendment by denying that right to reenfranchisement only to black felons. A State also would not violate the Nineteenth Amendment by denying the right only to female felons. And it would not violate the Twenty-Sixth Amendment by denying the right only to younger felons. According to the State's logic, none of the voting-rights amendments would have anything to say about discriminatory "reenfranchisement" laws, because reenfranchisement is "an act of grace" extended to a class that has no cognizable rights. To be sure, the State denied that implication of its position at oral argument, see Oral Argument at 7:00-8:00 (Aug. 18, 2020) (conceding that discriminatory reenfranchisement laws would violate the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments), and for good reason. Any of the discriminatory reenfranchisement laws described above would clearly violate the voting-rights amendments.
Consider the Supreme Court's treatment of literacy tests. Some States denied illiterate persons the right to vote after the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, a practice the Supreme Court held was then lawful. See Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347, 366, 35 S. Ct. 926, 59 L. Ed. 1340 (1915); Lassiter v. Northampton Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 50-53, 79 S. Ct. 985, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (1959). But even though States were free to deny the right to vote to all illiterate persons, the Fifteenth Amendment forbade them to discriminate within the class of illiterate non-voters by exempting only white citizens from literacy tests. See Guinn, 238 U.S. at 364-65.
In the same way, States may deny all felons the right to vote but may not, consistent with the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, discriminate among felons by extending the franchise to some felons while denying it to others by reason of their failure to pay a tax. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment, like the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments before it and the later Twenty-Sixth Amendment, applies whenever the State sets a voter qualification that extends the right to vote to some persons but denies it to others on a prohibited basis. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment plainly applies to felon reenfranchisement. The only remaining question is whether Florida denies some felons the right to vote "by reason of" their failure to pay a poll tax or other tax.
The felons argue that the phrase "by reason of" requires "the simple and traditional standard of but-for causation," which asks whether "a particular outcome would not have happened 'but for' the purported cause." Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1739, 207 L. Ed. 2d 218 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). Florida law violates the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, the felons argue, because Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 make their failure to pay court fees and costs a but-for cause of the denial of their right to vote. The problem with this argument is that the text of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment does not establish a but-for causal relationship between the failure to pay a tax and the denial of the right to vote.
To be sure, "[t]he phrase 'by reason of' denotes some form of causation." Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833, 1842, 201 L. Ed. 2d 141 (2018) (citing Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009)). But the phrase is not self-defining, and dictionary definitions are of limited value because they tend to define "because of," "by reason of," and "on account of" only in circular reference to one another. See, e.g., Account, Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1959) (defining "on account of" as "[f]or the sake of; by reason of; because of"); Reason, Oxford English Dictionary (1933) (defining "[b]y . . . reason of" as "on account of"). Indeed, the Supreme Court has explained that the phrase "by reason of" can bear meanings that range from but-for cause, Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 265-66, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992), all the way to sole cause, Husted, 138 S. Ct. at 1842-43. Absent a more specific definition in the text, we must look to context to determine whether "by reason of" in the Twenty-Fourth Amendment refers to but-for cause, sole cause, or some other relationship. See id. at 1842 (citing Holmes, 503 U.S. at 265-68); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts § 2, at 56 (2012) ("[W]ords are given meaning by their context . . . ."). And the context of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment forecloses the possibility that but-for causation is the relevant standard.
The most relevant context is the text of the other voting-rights amendments to the Constitution. The felons acknowledge this reality. They point to the fact that the "Twenty-Fourth Amendment's text mirrors the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments" as evidence that the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, like the other amendments, imposes a categorical ban on certain voting qualifications—a ban that is "not subject to exceptions in the rights-restoration context."
The felons are correct in one respect: just as it would plainly violate the other amendments to reenfranchise only white, male, or 30-year old felons, it would also violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to reenfranchise only felons who pay a poll tax—that is, a tax on the franchise itself. But the felons overlook one important difference between the Twenty-Fourth Amendment and the other amendments: the language it uses to describe the relationship between the denial of the right to vote and the prohibited basis of that denial.
Consider the text of all four voting-rights amendments. The Fifteenth Amendment says that the right to vote may not be denied "on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." U.S. Const. amend. XV, § 1 (emphasis added). The Nineteenth Amendment says that this right may not be denied "on account of sex." Id., amend. XIX (emphasis added). And the Twenty-Sixth Amendment says that it may not be denied to citizens age 18 or older "on account of age." Id., amend. XXVI, § 1 (emphasis added). In contrast, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment alone uses the phrase "by reason of" instead of "on account of."
A material variation in language suggests a variation in meaning. See Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 25, at 170-73; see also Akhil Reed Amar, Intratextualism, 112 Harv. L. Rev. 747, 761 (1999) ("[T]he same (or very similar) words in the same document should, at least presumptively, be construed in the same (or a very similar) way. But the flip side of the intratextual coin is that when two (or more) clauses feature different wording, this difference may also be a clue to meaning, and invite different construction of the different words."). So the text of the Constitution creates an inference that the right to vote stands in a different relationship to race, sex, and age than it does to the nonpayment of taxes. To understand this difference in meaning, one should begin with the meanings of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, both of which were well established when the Twenty-Fourth Amendment was ratified. With an understanding of those amendments in place, evidence surrounding the ratification of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment makes clear that the difference in language reflects a difference in meaning.
The Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments are best understood to forbid any voter qualification that makes race or sex a but-for cause of the denial of the right to vote. The relationship between the right to vote and a person's race is the most thoroughly discussed in Supreme Court precedent, and the but-for causation principle is clear in that context. Race is never a permissible criterion for determining the scope of the franchise. And this understanding extends to the Nineteenth Amendment's prohibition of sex-based voter qualifications.
The Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition on accounting for race as a voter qualification is absolute. This prohibition is powerful enough to "remove . . . or render inoperative" any suffrage provision in a state constitution that refers to race, even in the absence of implementing legislation by Congress. Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 389, 26 L. Ed. 567 (1880); accord Guinn, 238 U.S. at 363. The amendment has similar bite even when States impose discriminatory voting qualifications by facially neutral means. In Guinn, the Supreme Court invalidated an amendment to the Constitution of Oklahoma that created a literacy test for voting but exempted from the test any person who was eligible to vote before the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment. 238 U.S. at 364-67. Although the state constitution "contain[ed] no express words" limiting the franchise "on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude," the grandfather clause "inherently [brought] that result into existence," which violated the Fifteenth Amendment. Id. at 364-65. As the Supreme Court explained in another early decision interpreting the Fifteenth Amendment: "If citizens of one race having certain qualifications are permitted by law to vote, those of another having the same qualifications must be." United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 218, 23 L. Ed. 563 (1875). If changing a voter's race changes his eligibility to vote, the law is invalid. Cf. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1739.
To be sure, our nation failed to achieve the egalitarian goal of the Fifteenth Amendment to any significant degree until Congress used its power under section 2 of the amendment to enact the Voting Rights Act of 1965. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 308-09, 86 S. Ct. 803, 15 L. Ed. 2d 769 (1966). But the amendment established a powerful baseline: States must set voter qualifications without any regard to race. The Fifteenth Amendment does not subject race-based voter qualifications to strict scrutiny—they are per se unconstitutional. See Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 511-12, 120 S. Ct. 1044, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2000). It ensures that any argument that a race-based voter qualification is "tied rationally to the fulfillment" of an important government interest, id. at 548 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted), falls on deaf ears. "There is no room under the Amendment for the concept that the right to vote in a particular election can be allocated based on race." Id. at 523 (majority opinion). If a State acts in any way to make race relevant to voter qualifications, either facially or with a discriminatory purpose, it violates the Fifteenth Amendment. See Reno v. Bossier Par. Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 481, 117 S. Ct. 1491, 137 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1997) (citing City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 62, 100 S. Ct. 1490, 64 L. Ed. 2d 47 (1980) (plurality opinion)).
The Nineteenth Amendment forbids the use of sex as a voter qualification in the same way. The Supreme Court has discussed the Nineteenth Amendment in detail only twice—once in a decision upholding the amendment against a challenge to its validity, Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 136, 42 S. Ct. 217, 66 L. Ed. 505 (1922), and once in a decision upholding a poll tax that included an exception for nonvoting women, Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U.S. 277, 279-80, 58 S. Ct. 205, 82 L. Ed. 252 (1937), overruled by Harper, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S. Ct. 1079, 16 L. Ed. 2d 169. In both decisions, the Court confirmed that the Nineteenth Amendment operates just like the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court explained in Leser that the Nineteenth Amendment "is in character and phraseology precisely similar to the Fifteenth." 258 U.S. at 136. And in Breedlove, the Court stated that the Nineteenth Amendment, like the Fifteenth, is an absolute and self-enforcing prohibition on discriminatory classifications in voting. 302 U.S. at 283 ("[The Nineteenth Amendment] applies to men and women alike and by its own force supersedes inconsistent measures, whether federal or state." (citing Leser, 258 U.S. at 135)).
By the time Congress proposed the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in 1962, the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, which provided that the right to vote could not be denied or abridged "on account of race" or "on account of sex," were clearly and correctly understood to prevent the States from making a person's eligibility to vote turn in any way on race or sex. Under the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, a but-for-causation test like the one the felons propose accurately reflects the constitutional rule. When a State sets a voter qualification that would allow a person to vote but for the person's race or sex, it violates the Constitution.
But the Twenty-Fourth Amendment did not adopt the language of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments wholesale. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment prohibits States from denying the right vote "by reason of" the failure to pay a tax, not "on account of" it. If possible, that different language should be given a different meaning. Interpreting the phrase "by reason of" only as a synonym for "on account of" violates well-established principles of textual interpretation. See Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 25, at 170-73.
Ample evidence supports the conclusion that "by reason of" in the Twenty-Fourth Amendment does not refer to but-for causation. To begin, the only Supreme Court decision to apply the amendment does not reflect a but-for causal standard. In Harman v. Forssenius, decided only a year after ratification of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, the Court considered a Virginia law enacted in anticipation of the amendment that allowed voters to forego payment of their poll taxes and still vote in federal elections if they filed a "certificate of residence" at least six months before the election. 380 U.S. 528, 531-32, 85 S. Ct. 1177, 14 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1965). Because the Twenty-Fourth Amendment "nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of impairing the right guaranteed" and the certificate requirement "perpetuat[ed] . . . the disenfranchising characteristics of the poll tax which the Twenty-fourth Amendment was designed to eliminate," the Supreme Court held that the certificate requirement was an unconstitutional substitute for the poll tax. Id. at 540-42 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Harman Court based its decision on the rule that a State may not impose "a material requirement solely upon those who refuse to surrender their constitutional right to vote in federal elections without paying a poll tax." Id. at 541.
If the felons are correct that the Twenty-Fourth Amendment prohibits States from setting voter qualifications that make the failure to pay a tax a but-for cause of the denial of the right to vote, then the rule Harman announced was unexpectedly narrow. Under the law challenged in Harman, voters were turned away if they failed to either pay a poll tax or file a certificate of registration—each failure was a but-for cause of the denial of the right to vote. So if but-for causation were the relevant standard, most of the analysis in Harman, and the entire rule quoted above, would have been unnecessary. The Court could have decided the case by pointing out that the failure to pay a tax was part of the causal chain that led to the denial of the right to vote. So Harman suggests that the Twenty-Fourth Amendment requires a tighter relationship between nonpayment of a tax and denial of the right to vote than but-for causation.
Other settled principles confirm that the Twenty-Fourth Amendment does not adopt a but-for causal standard. Richardson allows States to disenfranchise all felons upon conviction; it makes no exception for felons who were convicted because they failed to pay their taxes. 418 U.S. at 56. And the Twenty-Fourth Amendment has never been understood to prohibit States from disenfranchising tax felons, even if the failure to pay taxes is a but-for cause of their disenfranchisement. See generally Sloan G. Speck, Comment, "Failure to Pay Any Poll Tax or Other Tax": The Constitutionality of Tax Felon Disenfranchisement, 74 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1549 (2007). The en banc Ninth Circuit has similarly held that requiring voters to present identification at the polls does not violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment even though obtaining identification "may have a cost." Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 407. That conclusion is consistent with the plurality opinion in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, which concluded that Indiana's voter-identification law was facially constitutional, 553 U.S. at 204, even as it acknowledged that obtaining valid identification could involve paying between $ 3 and $ 12 to obtain a copy of one's birth certificate, id. at 198 n.17.
Because the phrase "by reason of" cannot refer only to but-for causation, it is necessary to consider other possible meanings. Focusing on the main word in that phrase yields an answer: the Twenty-Fourth Amendment prohibits denials of the right to vote for which the failure to pay a tax is not only the but-for cause, but also the reason for the State's action.
The word "reason" has multiple commonly used subsenses. Some of them, of course, are closely related to but-for causation. See, e.g., Reason, Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1959) ("A ground or cause"). But the Twenty-Fourth Amendment's textual divergence from the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments, together with other contextual clues, eliminates these subsenses from consideration. Many of the other subsenses of the word "reason" relate to the concept of justification, itself a kind of causation. For example, "reason" may refer to an "expression or statement offered . . . as a justification of an act or procedure" or a "consideration, motive, or judgment . . . leading to an action or course of action; a rational ground or motive." Id. This second, justification-based subsense controls the meaning of "by reason of" in the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.
Under this second subsense, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment prohibits denials of the right to vote motivated by a person's failure to pay a tax. It does not prohibit every voting requirement with any causal relationship to the payment of a tax. If a State establishes a legitimate voter qualification for constitutionally legitimate reasons, it does not violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment—even if the qualification sometimes denies the right to vote because a person failed to pay a tax. To take the most obvious example, a requirement that voters have no felony convictions is lawful even if the but-for cause of a felony conviction is the failure to pay taxes. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment does not forbid the disenfranchisement of tax felons.
That conclusion finds support in Harman, the only Supreme Court decision to apply the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. Central to Harman's reasoning was the Court's judgment that the certificate-of-residency alternative was designed as a "substitute" for the poll tax, which in turn "was born of a desire to disenfranchise the Negro." 380 U.S. at 542-43. The Court also concluded that Virginia's scheme was not necessary to enforce its residency requirements, especially considering that forty-six States were able to limit the electorate to residents without resort to similar measures. Id. In the light of those realities, it was clear that Virginia lacked a legitimate justification for its law—the State's bifurcated registration system was motivated by a desire to tax the franchise. Because Virginia had no constitutionally legitimate reason for its law that made the failure to pay a tax a but-for cause of the denial of the right to vote, Harman held that the law violated the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.
Even if court costs and fees imposed in a criminal sentence were taxes, Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 would not violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. To be sure, if these obligations were taxes, the failure to pay them would be a but-for cause of continued disenfranchisement, just as the failure to pay the poll tax was a but-for cause of the denial of the right to vote in Harman. But unlike the law in Harman, Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 are a legitimate exercise of Florida's power to set core voter qualifications. The reason these laws leave some felons disenfranchised—the justification for their continued disenfranchisement—is not their failure to pay a tax. It is instead Florida's legitimate interest in restoring to the electorate only fully rehabilitated felons who have satisfied the demands of justice. Because the justification for the voting qualifications in Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 is a constitutionally legitimate interest and not the failure to pay a tax, they satisfy the requirements of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.
The dissenters support their argument against this interpretation with several pages of appeals to legislative history. See Jordan Dissent at 186-88. Even were we to assume that some recourse to legislative history is appropriate in the interpretation of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment—and we do not, see Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 66, at 369—the committee reports, floor debates, and press statements from politicians cited by the dissenters would not be the best evidence. In fact, the legislative history supports an interpretation that gives the phrase "by reason of" in the Twenty-Fourth Amendment a different meaning than the phrase "on account of" in the other voting-rights amendments. The House Judiciary Committee considered several proposed versions of a poll-tax amendment, including two that used the same "on account of" language as the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments. Abolition of Poll Tax in Federal Elections: Hearings Before Subcommittee No. 5 of the Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Cong. 1-5 (1962). But the language that the committee reported out, which was eventually presented to the states and ratified as the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, used the different "by reason of" construction. H.R. Rep. No. 1821, at 1-2 (1962). Giving different phrases different meanings makes all the more sense when it can be shown that the drafter considered and rejected consistent language.
 C. Florida Has Not Violated the Due Process Clause.
Although the district court did not decide whether Florida's reenfranchisement laws violate the Due Process Clause, part of its injunction cannot be justified by any of its other rulings. The district court declared Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 unconstitutional as applied to felons who cannot determine the amount of their outstanding financial obligations with diligence, and it created a process under which felons could request an opinion from the Division of Elections stating their total amount of outstanding fines and restitution. The injunction allowed any felon who did not receive an answer within 21 days to register and vote, and it prohibited the defendants from causing or assisting in the prosecution of any persons who registered or voted under this process. The felons ask us to affirm these aspects of the injunction on the grounds that the relevant Florida laws are void for vagueness and deny them procedural due process.
We first address the vagueness challenge. To register to vote in Florida, a person must affirm that he is not disqualified from voting because of a felony conviction. And it is a crime for a person to "willfully submit[] any false voter registration information," Fla. Stat. § 104.011(2), or to "willfully vote[] at any election" "knowing he or she is not a qualified elector," id. § 104.15. The felons argue these criminal laws are void for vagueness because Senate Bill 7066 makes it difficult or impossible for some felons to determine whether they are eligible to vote.
Under the Due Process Clause, a law is void for vagueness if it "fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes" or is "so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement." Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 595, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 192 L. Ed. 2d 569 (2015). But a law "is not vague because it may at times be difficult to prove an incriminating fact." FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253, 132 S. Ct. 2307, 183 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2012). Instead, a law is vague when "it is unclear as to what fact must be proved." Id. (emphasis added). And even laws that are "in some respects uncertain" may be upheld against a vagueness challenge if they contain a scienter requirement. United States v. Waymer, 55 F.3d 564, 568 (11th Cir. 1995); see also Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 149, 127 S. Ct. 1610, 167 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2007) ("The Court has made clear that scienter requirements alleviate vagueness concerns.").
The challenged laws are not vague. Felons and law enforcement can discern from the relevant statutes exactly what conduct is prohibited: a felon may not vote or register to vote if he knows that he has failed to complete all terms of his criminal sentence. See Fla. Stat. §§ 104.011(2), 104.15, 98.0751(1)-(2). This clear standard, which includes a scienter requirement, provides fair notice to prospective voters and "limit[s] prosecutorial discretion." Carhart, 550 U.S. at 150.
The felons' real complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a felon has completed the financial terms of his sentence. They offer examples of felons who cannot locate their criminal judgments, cannot determine which financial obligations were imposed for felony as opposed to misdemeanor offenses, or do not know how much they have paid toward their financial obligations. But these concerns arise not from a vague law but from factual circumstances that sometimes make it difficult to determine whether an incriminating fact exists. See United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 306, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008) (explaining that a law is not rendered vague by "the possibility that it will sometimes be difficult to determine" the existence of an incriminating fact). These difficulties in proving the facts that determine a felon's eligibility to vote cast no doubt on the clarity of the requirement that felons neither register nor vote if they know they have not satisfied the financial obligations imposed in their sentences. Because there is no uncertainty about "what fact must be proved" to convict a defendant under these statutes, the laws are not vague. Fox, 567 U.S. at 253; see also Williams, 553 U.S. at 305-06.
The felons argue that the State's "every dollar" policy makes the challenged laws vague, but that policy only narrows the scope of criminal liability. Cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 795-96, 109 S. Ct. 2746, 105 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1989). The challenged laws forbid felons to register or vote if they know they have failed to complete their sentences. And the policy adopts one of the narrowest possible constructions of "failing to complete" a sentence. Under the policy, a felon fails to complete the financial terms of his sentence only if his total payments toward all obligations related to his sentence—even financing costs that accrue after sentencing—are less than the amount imposed in his sentence. This narrowing construction mitigates vagueness concerns instead of enhancing them: a felon cannot reasonably think he has "completed" his terms of sentence if the total amount he has paid toward all related obligations is less than the amount included in his sentence. And only felons in this category are ineligible to vote under the "every dollar" policy.
The dissenters insist that the law is vague because some felons will not be certain about their eligibility, and a "wrong guess . . . results in severe consequences," possibly including "an arrest for a voting violation." Jordan Dissent at 169 (internal quotation marks omitted). Never mind the fact that no felon who honestly believes he has completed the terms of his sentence commits a crime by registering and voting, see Fla. Stat. §§ 104.011(2), 104.15 (establishing scienter requirements for voting violations), and that at least 85,000 felons felt the law was clear enough for them to go ahead and register. The dissenters' vagueness argument strains credulity.
The felons also argue that Florida has denied them procedural due process. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). They assert a liberty interest in the right to vote and argue that Florida has deprived them of that interest without adequate process. We may assume that the right to vote is a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. But see Johnson v. Hood, 430 F.2d 610, 612 (5th Cir. 1970) ("[E]ven an improper denial of the right to vote for a candidate for a state office achieved by state action is not a denial of a right of property or liberty secured by the due process clause." (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration adopted)). Even so, this argument fails because any deprivation of that right was accomplished through the legislative process and the process for adopting a constitutional amendment, which provide more than adequate procedures for the adoption of generally applicable rules regarding voter qualifications.
In deciding what the Due Process Clause requires when the State deprives persons of life, liberty or property, the Supreme Court has long distinguished between legislative and adjudicative action. See, e.g., Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 445-46, 36 S. Ct. 141, 60 L. Ed. 372 (1915). The State often deprives persons of liberty or property through legislative action—general laws that apply "to more than a few people." Id. at 445; see also 75 Acres, LLC v. Miami-Dade County, 338 F.3d 1288, 1296 (11th Cir. 2003) (deeming an action legislative because it was "enacted by a legislative body" performing a "fundamentally legislative" function or, alternatively, was "generally applicable" and "prospective in nature"). When the State does so, the affected persons are not entitled to any process beyond that provided by the legislative process. Bi-Metallic, 239 U.S. at 445 ("General statutes within the state power are passed that affect the person or property of individuals, sometimes to the point of ruin, without giving them a chance to be heard. Their rights are protected in the only way that they can be in a complex society, by their power, immediate or remote, over those who make the rule."); accord 75 Acres, 338 F.3d at 1294. In contrast, the Due Process Clause may require individual process when a State deprives persons of liberty or property through adjudicative actions—those that concern a "relatively small number of persons" who are "exceptionally affected, in each case upon individual grounds," by the state action. Bi-Metallic, 239 U.S. at 446; see also 75 Acres, 338 F.3d at 1294. To determine the process due for adjudicative deprivations, courts apply the familiar balancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18.
The felons were deprived of the right to vote through legislative action, not adjudicative action. Under its Constitution, Florida deprives all felons of the right to vote upon conviction. See Fla. Const. art. VI, § 4(a). This constitutional provision is a law "of general applicability" that plainly qualifies as legislative action. See 75 Acres, 338 F.3d at 1296-97. And even if we accept the argument that Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 deprive felons of the right to vote by conditioning reenfranchisement on the completion of all terms of sentence, those laws also qualify as legislative acts. See id. The legislative and constitutional-amendment processes gave the felons all the process they were due before Florida deprived them of the right to vote and conditioned the restoration of that right on completion of their sentences.
The felons complain that it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the facts that determine eligibility to vote under Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066, but this complaint is only another version of the vagueness argument we have already rejected. The Due Process Clause does not require States to provide individual process to help citizens learn the facts necessary to comply with laws of general application.
To avail themselves of the Mathews v. Eldridge framework, the felons were obliged to prove a deprivation of liberty based on adjudicative action. See 75 Acres, 338 F.3d at 1294. But the felons do not challenge any individual vote-religibility determinations that could qualify as adjudicative action, so Mathews does not apply. And in any event, Florida provides registered voters with adequate process before an individual determination of ineligibility. Before being removed from the voter registration system, voters are entitled to predeprivation notice and a hearing. Fla. Stat. § 98.075(5), (7). And any voter who is dissatisfied with the result is entitled to de novo review of the removal decision in state court. Id. § 98.0755. These procedures provide more than adequate process to guard against erroneous ineligibility determinations. See Mathews, 424 U.S. at 333-35.
The injunction the district court entered looks nothing like a remedy for a denial of due process. It does not require additional procedures for any existing adjudicative action that deprives felons of a liberty interest in voting. Instead, it creates an adjudicative process to aid felons in complying with nonvague laws of general application. States are certainly free to establish such a process—indeed, Florida has done so through its preregistration advisory-opinion process and accompanying immunity from criminal prosecution. But the notion that due process mandates this kind of procedure in the absence of any adjudicative action is unprecedented. The injunction did not remedy any denial of due process, so we cannot affirm it on that ground.
A fundamental confusion in this litigation has been the notion that the Due Process Clause somehow makes Florida responsible not only for giving felons notice of the standards that determine their eligibility to vote but also for locating and providing felons with the facts necessary to determine whether they have completed their financial terms of sentence. The Due Process Clause imposes no such obligation. States are constitutionally entitled to set legitimate voter qualifications through laws of general application and to require voters to comply with those laws through their own efforts. So long as a State provides adequate procedures to challenge individual determinations of ineligibility—as Florida does—due process requires nothing more.
 IV. CONCLUSION
We REVERSE the judgment of the district court and VACATE the challenged portions of its injunction. We LIFT the stay of the cross-appeal, Case No. 20-12304, and DIRECT the Clerk to sever the cross-appeal, issue a briefing schedule for it, and assign a panel to resolve it.
