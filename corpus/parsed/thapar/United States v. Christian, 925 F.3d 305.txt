, concurring. I concur in the majority opinion. There was probable cause to search Tyrone Christian's house, and, at the very least, the officers executed that search in good faith. But because of our precedent, we must ignore critical evidence of which the officers undisputedly knew and isolate the good-faith analysis to the four corners of the affidavit. See United States v. Laughton, 409 F.3d 744, 751-52 (6th Cir. 2005). I write separately to explain why Laughton's limit on the good-faith exception conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and should be overruled.
I.
Officer Thomas Bush's affidavit included a number of facts linking Christian and his house to drug trafficking: (1) Christian had four drug-crime convictions in the past nineteen years (two of which involved conduct that occurred at his house); (2) a confidential informant had purchased drugs from Christian at his house nine months earlier; (3) within the past four months, several "subjects" told the officers that they had purchased "large quantities" of drugs from Christian at his house; and, finally, (4) on the day of the search, officers stopped Rueben Thomas after they saw him leave the "area of" Christian's house and discovered 20 grams of heroin in Thomas's car. R. 42-1, Pg. ID 114-15. Critically, Thomas's heroin showed current drug dealing at Christian's house, supplementing the older information in Bush's affidavit. But the link between Thomas's heroin and Christian's house was blurry because the affidavit was vague. The affidavit did not say that the officers saw Thomas interact with Christian or that they saw Thomas inside Christian's house—only that they saw him "walk away from the area of" Christian's house. Id. at 115.
Still, the magistrate believed the affidavit was good enough and granted the officers' request for a search warrant. After obtaining the warrant, the officers  searched Christian's house and uncovered extensive evidence of drug dealing: marijuana, cocaine, heroin, drug packaging materials, and two guns. Based on this evidence, Christian was convicted of possessing a  controlled substance with intent to distribute, possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Christian claims the evidence against him should have been suppressed, arguing that the officers lacked probable cause to search his house and that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply. Because of Laughton, the parties' good-faith arguments are restricted to the language of the affidavit. And because that language is vague on a critical point—the link between Thomas's heroin and Christian's house—the parties parse through the affidavit and debate the best interpretation of its language (almost as if they were interpreting a statute).
But uncontroverted evidence shows that on the day of the search, surveilling officers twice observed Thomas interacting with Christian at Christian's house. First, Thomas met with Christian for "approximately five minutes" in the driveway of his house. R. 152, Pg. ID 1131-32. Then, later that afternoon, Thomas returned and went inside for about two hours. After he left, the officers stopped him and discovered the heroin. These facts link Thomas and his heroin to Christian and his house. But, unfortunately, they were left out of the affidavit. The first encounter did not make it into the affidavit at all, and the second one did only in the vague terms described above.
Laughton confines us to the words of that vague affidavit in evaluating whether the good-faith exception applies. We cannot consider the officers' actual observations or determine the reason those observations did not make it into the affidavit.
II.
Laughton is wrong. To see why, we need to start with first principles. The Fourth Amendment protects "[t]he right of the people to be secure . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures." U.S. Const. amend. IV. But it does not spell out how we are to protect that right. When the Fourth Amendment was ratified, the only way to enforce its protections was through private tort suits against officers—the exclusionary rule, Section 1983, and Bivens actions did not yet exist. See Collins v. Virginia, 138 S. Ct. 1663, 1676, 201 L. Ed. 2d 9 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) ("Historically, the only remedies for unconstitutional searches and seizures were 'tort suits' and  'self-help.'"); Gardner v. Neil, 4 N.C. 104, 104, 1 Car. L. Rep. 492 (1814) (stating that "the action of trespass is the only proper form of action" for a Fourth Amendment violation); Akhil R. Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, 100 Yale L.J. 1131, 1176-78 (1991); William Baude & James Y. Stern, The Positive Law Model of the Fourth Amendment, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 1821, 1840 (2016).
That changed in 1914 when the Supreme Court first excluded evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652, T.D. 1964 (1914). The facts in Weeks were extreme: officers, lacking any particularized information or a warrant, broke into the defendant's home, took incriminating documents, then returned and took even more. See id. at 386, 393-94. To deter such flagrant misconduct by law enforcement, the Supreme Court created the exclusionary rule. Id. at 393-94; see also United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906, 908, 916-17, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984). The underlying premise is that police are less likely to engage in misconduct if they  know that any evidence obtained thereby will be inadmissible at trial.
But the Supreme Court has recognized that suppression often comes with its own "substantial" costs—both to the criminal justice system (letting the guilty (and possibly dangerous) go free) and to the truth-seeking process. Leon, 468 U.S. at 907-08. So the Supreme Court has repeatedly reminded us that suppression should always be "our last resort, not our first impulse." Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135, 140, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496 (2009) (quoting Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2006)) (internal quotation mark omitted). In turn, several principles constrain the application of the exclusionary rule. First, exclusion is not an individual right but a rule aimed at deterrence. Id. at 141. Second, a Fourth Amendment violation is a necessary—but not a sufficient—ground for exclusion. Id. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the value of any future police deterrence must outweigh suppression's "substantial social costs." Hudson, 547 U.S. at 596.
Assuming there is a Fourth Amendment violation, how exactly should courts balance the costs versus the benefits of suppression? Again, the Supreme Court tells us: look at the misconduct. Exclusion must deter egregious misconduct—misconduct "sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system." Herring, 555 U.S. at 144. In contrast, when officers act in an objectively reasonable but mistaken manner, exclusion serves no purpose. Leon, 468 U.S. at 919. That is so even if that mistake violated a suspect's Fourth Amendment rights. See Hudson, 547 U.S. at 596.
In short, the ultimate focus must be on the nature of police misconduct. That conduct must exhibit "deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment rights" to trigger the exclusionary rule. Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. 229, 238, 131 S. Ct. 2419, 180 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); Herring, 555 U.S. at 144 (adding systemic negligence to the list).
III.
Of course, focusing on police misconduct does not excuse courts from looking at the affidavit. Indeed, the affidavit is where courts must start. Leon, 468 U.S. at 915. But the ultimate inquiry is whether, considering "all of the circumstances," the officers acted reasonably when relying on the blessing of the judge. Herring, 555 U.S. at 145 (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 922 n.23). And to make this determination, "we must consider the actions of all the police officers involved." Id. at 140 (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 923 n.24).
This is where Laughton went astray. Laughton's refusal to look beyond the affidavit is, in effect, a judgment that factual omissions are always culpable misconduct. To start, Leon precludes such an all-or-nothing approach to the exclusionary rule. 468 U.S. at 922 n.23, 923 n.24 (explaining that good faith depends on "all of the circumstances"). But more importantly, the underlying premise is not true—omitted facts usually do not stem from misconduct at all but from isolated negligence or the time pressures that officers often face during investigations. Indeed, an officer would have practically no incentive to leave favorable information out of an affidavit. See Hudson, 547 U.S. at 596 (stating "the value of  deterrence depends upon the strength of the incentive to commit the forbidden act"). Doing so would only increase the chance that a magistrate may reject the warrant application and "leav[e] the officer empty-handed." United States v. Thomas, 908 F.3d 68, 74-75 & n.3 (4th Cir. 2018).
Because there is no nefarious conduct to deter, the best that excluding evidence may do in this scenario is encourage more careful affidavit drafting. While that is a laudable goal, it is not worth the substantial costs of exclusion. See Herring, 555 U.S. at 141; Hudson, 547 U.S. at 596. Those costs are particularly high in an omitted-facts situation: when an officer in fact reasonably  relied on the magistrate's warrant for a search, and that search yielded evidence proving that the defendant is in fact guilty. Under that scenario, the exclusionary rule cannot "pay its way." Davis, 564 U.S. at 238 (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 919).
The Supreme Court's instruction to focus on culpability is enough to show that the good-faith analysis must consider facts that are not included in the affidavit. But the Supreme Court has been even more explicit. In Sheppard, an officer under severe time pressure used the wrong warrant application form for his search (a form for drugs rather than murder). Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U.S. 981, 986, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737 (1984). The magistrate judge explained that edits were necessary but only made some of them; as a result, the warrant still authorized only a search for drugs. Id. at 986-87. Despite the obvious error, the Court held that the good-faith exception applied. In doing so, it rejected the argument that the officers' reliance on a facially invalid warrant undermined good faith. Given the circumstances, "[t]he officers . . . took every step that could reasonably be expected of them." Id. at 987-89. Among other things, they thoroughly investigated the suspect in a short amount of time, sought the advice of a district attorney, presented the warrant application to a judge, and trusted that he had fixed it. Id. at 984, 988-89. Those facts were not in the affidavit but still were relevant to the Sheppard court. Thus, Sheppard "forecloses . . . a categorical rule" that the good-faith exception depends entirely on the face of the warrant itself. United States v. Franz, 772 F.3d 134, 146 (3d Cir. 2014); accord United States v. Frazier, 423 F.3d 526, 534-35 (6th Cir. 2005). And Sheppard's logic extends to affidavits and any other documents in a warrant application.
Indeed, our sister circuits have applied the good-faith exception when affidavits (often prepared under time pressure) omitted a few words that were needed to establish probable cause. See, e.g., United States v. McKenzie-Gude, 671 F.3d 452, 456-57, 460 (4th Cir. 2011); United States v. Martin, 297 F.3d 1308, 1320 (11th Cir. 2002). Even the Tenth Circuit, which purportedly follows a "four corners" rule, still considers (1) additional information presented to the issuing judge, (2) "information relating to the warrant application process," and (3) "testimony illuminating how a reasonable officer would interpret factual information contained in an affidavit." See United States v. Knox, 883 F.3d 1262, 1272 & n.9 (10th Cir. 2018).
 In addition, we already allow courts to look outside facially valid documents to see if there was a Fourth Amendment violation that compels suppression. For example, if a facially valid warrant was rooted in culpable misconduct, then the good-faith exception does not apply. See Herring, 555 U.S. at 146 ("If the police have been shown to be reckless in maintaining a warrant system, or to have  knowingly made false entries to lay the groundwork for future false arrests, exclusion would certainly be justified . . . ."); see also Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978). Likewise, a facially valid warrant cannot support good faith if the officers purposely withheld damaging information from it to present an "incomplete and misleading" picture to the magistrate. United States v. West, 520 F.3d 604, 611-12 (6th Cir. 2008). In other words, we already consider facts outside the affidavit when evaluating good faith—we just consider facts that undermine probable cause and ignore facts that support it. Under Laughton, outside facts are a one-way ratchet in favor of criminals. This disparity upsets the cost-benefit balance at the heart of the good-faith exception: we should only undermine the truth-finding function of the criminal justice system when necessary to deter culpable misconduct.
IV.
What would a world without Laughton look like in practice? No court can envision every situation in which good faith does or does not apply. But a few things are clear. Whenever an affidavit's four corners are thorough enough to satisfy Leon, the good-faith exception applies (barring some sort of culpable misconduct by the police). Indeed, Leon is a low bar. An affidavit exceeds the Leon bar when it contains "some connection" between "the illegal activity and the place to be searched," even if that connection is "remote" and supported by only a slight "modicum of evidence." United States v. White, 874 F.3d 490, 496-97 (6th Cir. 2017) (quoting United States v. Carpenter, 360 F.3d 591, 596 (6th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Too often courts raise the Leon bar, making it practically indistinguishable from the probable cause standard itself.1  Doing so effectively eliminates the  good-faith exception, or at the very least reduces it to a limited, narrow role. But when properly applied, Leon means that in most cases an affidavit will satisfy the good-faith exception. In the instances when an affidavit is vague on a critical point, however, courts must go further and ask whether the officers were objectively culpable in relying on that affidavit. To answer that question, courts must consider all the circumstances that bear on the officers' culpability, including any time pressure that the officers were under, what facts were known to the officers but omitted from the affidavit, and how defective the affidavit was without that omitted information.
The dissent claims that this culpability-focused approach would entail a subjective "expedition into the minds of police officers." Dissenting Op. Part II (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 922 n.23). Yet the Supreme Court already explained that looking at an "officer's knowledge and experience . . . does not make the test . . . subjective." Herring, 555 U.S. at 145-46 (emphasis added). Courts are not "inquiring into the subjective beliefs of law enforcement officers" when they consider  "actual uncontroverted facts" known to them. McKenzie-Gude, 671 F.3d at 460-61 (citing Herring, 555 U.S. at 145). Neither the good-faith exception nor Supreme Court precedent require that we bury our heads in the sand and ignore uncontroverted evidence. We should follow the Supreme Court's lead and consider such evidence when determining the officers' culpability. See Herring, 555 U.S. at 146-47; Sheppard, 468 U.S. at 987-89. To do anything less is to ignore the very purpose for the exclusionary rule in the first place.
Indeed, this case proves the point. Surveilling officers twice observed Thomas interacting with Christian at Christian's house. That is an uncontroverted fact, not a subjective belief. And that fact, had it been included in the affidavit, would have at the very least established good faith under Leon. A tight time constraint, not culpable conduct, is the most likely reason that this information was left out. See Majority Op. Part II.A. In contrast, if officers saw Thomas at a different house meeting with someone other than Christian, this would be a different case. In that light, the vague language in the affidavit ("the area of" Christian's house) would objectively appear to be intentional obfuscation rather than negligent oversight.  R. 42-1, Pg. ID 115. And under those circumstances, the outside facts would support suppression. But with the facts we have, suppressing the evidence serves no societal purpose.
In short, courts can only apply the good-faith exception by evaluating officer conduct and can only evaluate officer conduct by looking beyond the four corners of the affidavit. The time has come for us to get in line with the Supreme Court's good-faith doctrine. We should overrule Laughton.
