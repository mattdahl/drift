, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join Judge Siler's thoughtful opinion with one reservation: We have no business deciding whether the Michigan court properly applied its contemporaneous-objection rule. Accordingly, I would not reconsider whether the timing of Bickham's objections amounted to procedural default under Michigan law. Once we determine that the state court applied a procedural rule that was independent of federal law and adequate to support the state court's judgment, we should go no further.
State courts have the final say on the meaning of state law. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991); see also Elmendorf v. Taylor, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 152, 160, 6 L. Ed. 289 (1825) (Marshall, C.J.). Accordingly, many of our sister circuits have noted that federal habeas courts should not rethink state-court applications of state procedural-default rules. See, e.g., Suny v. Pennsylvania, 687 F. App'x 170, 175 (3d Cir. 2017) ("[F]ederal courts generally will not consider whether the state court properly applied its own default rule to the petitioner's facts."); Sharpe v. Bell, 593 F.3d 372, 377 (4th Cir. 2010) ("A federal habeas court does not have license to question a state court's finding of procedural default or to question whether the state court properly applied its own law."); Sweet v. Delo, 125 F.3d 1144, 1151 (8th Cir. 1997) ("It is not the office of a federal habeas court to determine that a state court made a mistake of state law."); Barksdale v. Lane, 957 F.2d 379, 383-84 (7th Cir. 1992) ("A federal court sitting in habeas corpus is required to respect a state court's finding of waiver or procedural default under state law. Federal courts do not sit to correct errors made by state courts in the interpretation and application of state law." (alterations and citations omitted)); see also Fuller v. Pacheco, 531 F. App'x 864, 868 (10th Cir. 2013); Poland v. Stewart, 169 F.3d 573, 584 (9th Cir. 1999); Richardson v. Thigpen, 883 F.2d 895, 898 (11th Cir. 1989) (per curiam). Traditional notions of federalism dictate that we follow these circuits' lead.
