, concurring. I join the majority opinion in full. But since the question here has divided our sister circuits, I write separately to explain why.
To begin with, I should emphasize that the allegations in this case are troubling. The plaintiffs allege facts suggesting that Michigan State University seriously mismanaged its Title IX process. And that matters to everyone involved—the victims, the accused, their families and friends, and the broader University community. Everyone has an interest in a timely, fair, and transparent process for resolving claims of sexual assault. So long as we expect universities to adjudicate such claims, we should expect them to do better.
 But this case is not about whether the University mismanaged its Title IX process. Rather, the question here is whether Michigan State University "subjected" the plaintiffs to "discrimination" (as those terms are used in Title IX). To answer that question, the parties agree, we should look to the Supreme Court's decision in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 119 S. Ct. 1661, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1999). There, the Court decided that a school may be held liable for "student-on-student harassment" only if the school "acts with deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its programs or activities" and that harassment is "severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive." Id. at 633. The parties also agree that Davis established a causation requirement. The Court made clear that a school "may not be liable for damages unless its deliberate indifference 'subjects' its students to harassment." Id. at 644 (alteration adopted). Yet the parties—as well as our sister circuits—disagree about what this requirement entails.
That confusion has arisen based on the Supreme Court's definition of the term "subjects." In Davis, the Court said that the school's deliberate indifference must "'cause students to undergo' harassment or 'make them liable or vulnerable' to it." Id. at 645 (alteration adopted) (quoting Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1415 (1966); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2275 (1961)). Some courts have read this language broadly. Students must allege only that the school's deliberate indifference made harassment more likely, not that  it actually led to any harassment. See, e.g., Farmer v. Kan. State Univ., 918 F.3d 1094, 1103-04 (10th Cir. 2019); Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 504 F.3d 165, 172 (1st Cir. 2007), rev'd on other grounds, 555 U.S. 246, 129 S. Ct. 788, 172 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009). Other courts have read the language more narrowly. Students must allege that the school's deliberate indifference actually led to harassment, not that it only made such harassment more likely. See, e.g., K.T. v. Culver-Stockton Coll., 865 F.3d 1054, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2017); Escue v. N. Okla. Coll., 450 F.3d 1146, 1155-56 (10th Cir. 2006); Reese v. Jefferson Sch. Dist. No. 14J, 208 F.3d 736, 740 (9th Cir. 2000).
Today, our circuit adopts the latter view, and I think rightly so. Under Title IX, schools can "subject" their students to harassment in two different ways. First, the school can "cause" the harassment directly. Imagine, for instance, that the school sent disparaging emails to just its female students. In that scenario, we would have no trouble saying that the school had "subjected" the students to harassment. After all, the school's conduct quite directly led to the harassment. Yet Davis also said that schools can "subject" their students to harassment in a second way: the school can make its students "vulnerable" to harassment. Take the facts of Davis itself. There, the school "subjected" a student to harassment because it failed to take any effort to prevent or end ongoing harassment by another student. Davis, 526 U.S. at 635, 654. Unlike in the first scenario, the school's conduct did not directly cause the harassment. But still the Court concluded that the school had "effectively caused" the harassment. Id. at 642-43 (cleaned up). And that's because the school's conduct indirectly led to the harassment: it left the student vulnerable to her harasser.
But in either scenario, we wouldn't say that the school had "subjected" its students to harassment if the students never experienced any harassment as a result of the school's conduct. To be "subjected" to a harm, as a matter of ordinary English,  requires that you experience that harm. And that holds true whether someone directly causes the harm or simply makes you vulnerable to it.
That more precise reading also makes sense when you consider the specific statutory text. Under Title IX, "[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex . . . be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving [federal funding]."  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). If a person can be "subjected to harassment" without experiencing any harassment as a result of the defendant's conduct, then a person can also be "subjected to discrimination" without experiencing any discrimination as well. And that surely can't be right. The Supreme Court has long debated whether the phrase "subjected to discrimination" (used in various statutes) requires the plaintiff to prove a discriminatory intent. See, e.g., Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of City of New York, 463 U.S. 582, 103 S. Ct. 3221, 77 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1983). But no one has questioned whether the plaintiff must prove some discriminatory effect.
Consider also the statutory context. The phrase "subjected to discrimination" appears in a parallel list with the phrases "excluded from participation" and "denied the benefits." 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). To "exclude" means to "shut out," "hinder the entrance of," or "expel." Random House Dictionary of the English Language 497 (1966); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2275 (1961). So to be "excluded from participation" means that something blocked your participation—not just that something made it more likely that you wouldn't be able to participate. To "deny" (as relevant here) means "to withhold" or "refuse to grant." Random House Dictionary of the English Language 387 (1966); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 603 (1961). So to be "denied [ ] benefits" means that something held the benefits back—not just that something made it more likely that you wouldn't be able to receive them. This context reinforces the point. To be "subjected to discrimination" means that something led you to experience discrimination—not just that something made it more likely that you would face it.
And if you're still not convinced, two more points favor this reading. First, Congress enacted Title IX under the Spending Clause. See Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 287, 118 S. Ct. 1989, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1998). In effect, Congress offered the states a deal: they would receive federal funding so long as they complied with the requirements of Title IX. But the states could not knowingly accept that offer if they didn't know its terms. So Congress had to identify any condition on its funding "unambiguously." Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S. Ct. 1531, 67 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1981). And if it didn't, then the states may not be held liable for a violation. See Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287-88. So even if there were any ambiguity, that very ambiguity would require us to adopt the less expansive reading of Title IX.
 Second, the opinion in Davis itself supports this reading. There, the Court went to great lengths to emphasize the narrowness of its decision. See Davis, 526 U.S. at 648-49, 652-53. And it expressly warned against any "characterization" of its opinion that would "mislead courts to impose more sweeping liability" than Title IX requires. Id. at 652. But some of our sister circuits have adopted just such a characterization. To hold schools liable for any act or omission that makes students "vulnerable to" harassment is to hold schools liable for a wide range of decisions. Could a university be held liable for reducing its Title IX staff  as a result of budget cuts? What about for allowing a bar to open on campus? Or for expanding coed housing options? All these decisions could make students vulnerable to harassment. Yet surely Title IX does not make schools liable for these everyday decisions. In short, I would not read the term "subjects" so broadly as to erase the causation requirement enacted by Congress and confirmed by the Supreme Court.
Of course, all this does not resolve what should count as "discrimination" under Title IX. But the plaintiffs in this case premised their suit on student-on-student harassment. And Davis made clear that "discrimination" in such cases means "severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive" harassment—not just the risk of harassment. Id. at 650. We have no authority to say otherwise.
For these reasons, the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Title IX. The plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that they experienced any harassment after Michigan State University had notice of their complaints. As a result, they cannot show that the University "subjected" them to harassment.
