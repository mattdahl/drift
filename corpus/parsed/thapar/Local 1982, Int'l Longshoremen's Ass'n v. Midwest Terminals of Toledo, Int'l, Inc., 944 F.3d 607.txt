, concurring. Courts have long struggled to define what it means for a decision to be "final." Over a century ago, the Supreme Court observed that "[p]robably no question of equity practice" had "been the subject of more frequent discussion" and confessed that its cases on the issue were "not altogether harmonious." McGourkey v. Toledo & O. C. R. Co., 146 U.S. 536, 545-46, 13 S. Ct. 170, 36 L. Ed. 1079 (1892). And matters have not improved much since then. See, e.g., Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 170, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974) ("No verbal formula yet devised can explain prior finality decisions with unerring accuracy or provide an utterly reliable guide for the future."). Even so, courts should do the best they can to bring some coherence to the doctrine. I write separately to flag one such area for our court.
This appeal arises from a long and somewhat complicated procedural history. But here most of the details don't matter. Almost a decade ago, Local 1982 of the International Longshoremen's Association received an arbitration award against Midwest Terminals of Toledo. In an initial appeal, our court confirmed the award and ordered it enforced. Local 1982, Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Midwest Terminals of Toledo, Int'l, Inc., 560 Fed. Appx. 529 (6th Cir. 2014) (Local 1982 I). In a later appeal, we affirmed an order remanding the award back to the arbitrator for clarification. Local 1982, Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Midwest Terminals of Toledo, Int'l, Inc., 694 Fed. Appx. 985 (6th Cir. 2017) (Local 1982 II). In this third appeal, Midwest challenges another order remanding the award for clarification.
Neither party questions our jurisdiction. Perhaps because our circuit has held that an order remanding an award back to the arbitrator for clarification is a "final decision" and thus appealable. M & C Corp. v. Erwin Behr GmbH & Co., KG, 326 F.3d 772, 779-81 (6th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). But that holding seems inconsistent with much of the law in this area.
Start with the principle of finality. The Supreme Court has made clear that a "final decision"—in the arbitration context and more generally—"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment." Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 86, 121 S. Ct. 513, 148 L. Ed. 2d 373 (2000) (citation omitted). And that rule applies no less to proceedings that occur  after the district court has entered a final judgment—as is the case here. Indeed, our circuit (like others) has explained that courts should view finality in post-judgment proceedings the same way they view finality more generally: they should ask whether the decision ends the post-judgment litigation. See JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Winget, 920 F.3d 1103, 1105-08 (6th Cir. 2019) (collecting cases).
So does a remand order end the litigation? It doesn't seem like it. Courts remand arbitration awards for clarification because they can't enforce ambiguous awards. See M & C Corp. v. Erwin Behr GmbH & Co., 143 F.3d 1033, 1038 (6th Cir. 1998). The remand allows the arbitrator to complete its assigned task (i.e., resolve the dispute between the parties) and allows the court to review the award with more information. See Green v. Ameritech Corp., 200 F.3d 967, 977 (6th Cir. 2000). By all appearances, then, the remand does not end the litigation. Rather, it contemplates that the parties will soon return to court for further enforcement proceedings.
If you have any doubts on that score, just look at our past cases. Recall that our court previously exercised jurisdiction over a remand order. See Local 1982 II, 694 Fed. Appx. at 986. And now the parties have returned to court with further grievances related to the remand. Ironically, this has happened before—in the very case that held that remand orders are final decisions. See M & C Corp., 326 F.3d at 774-78. So both logic and experience show that remands don't end the litigation on the merits.
Probably for that reason, every other circuit to address the issue has held (or at least implied) that an order that simply remands an award back to the arbitrator for clarification is not a final decision. See, e.g., Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 328 (1st Cir. 2000); Landy Michaels Realty Corp. v. Local 32B-32J, Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, AFL-CIO, 954 F.2d 794, 795-98 (2d Cir. 1992); Virgin Islands Hous. Auth. v. Coastal Gen. Constr. Servs. Corp., 27 F.3d 911, 913-14, 30 V.I. 417 (3d Cir. 1994); Murchison Capital Partners, L.P. v. Nuance Communs., Inc., 760 F.3d 418, 420-23 (5th Cir. 2014); Jays Foods, L.L.C. v. Chem. & Allied Prod. Workers Union, Local 20, AFL-CIO, 208 F.3d 610, 613 (7th Cir. 2000); Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. United Transp. Union, 3 F.3d 255, 258 (8th Cir. 1993); Cascade Nat. Gas Corp. v. Int'l Chem. Workers Union Council/UFCW Local 121-C, 776 Fed. Appx. 939, 940-41 (9th Cir. 2019) (order); cf. Sanchez v. Elizondo, 878 F.3d 1216, 1219 n.1 (9th Cir. 2018).
Finally, consider how our own circuit (as well as most other circuits) treats remand orders in three analogous contexts:
• Administrative Agencies. A remand back to an administrative agency for further proceedings is generally not final and appealable. See Schuck v. Frank, 27 F.3d 194, 196 (6th Cir. 1994); see also Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. S.E.C., 873 F.2d 325, 329-30, 277 U.S. App. D.C. 112 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (collecting cases).
• ERISA Administrators. A remand back to an ERISA plan administrator for further proceedings is generally not final and appealable. See Bowers v. Sheet Metal Workers' Nat. Pension Fund, 365 F.3d 535, 536 (6th Cir. 2004); see also Mead v. Reliastar Life Ins. Co., 768 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (collecting cases).
• Bankruptcy Courts. A remand back to a bankruptcy court for further proceedings is generally not final and appealable. See Settembre v. Fid. & Guar. Life Ins. Co., 552 F.3d 438, 441 (6th Cir. 2009); see also In re Holland, 539 F.3d 563, 565 (7th Cir. 2008) (collecting cases).
 These cases provide a simple rule: remand orders are generally not final and appealable.
Of course, as with most rules, there are exceptions. Courts have recognized that a remand order can be immediately appealable if a statute provides as much, see Bowers, 365 F.3d at 537-38, or if the remand involves purely ministerial matters, see Settembre, 552 F.3d at 441, or if the remand can only be challenged through an immediate appeal, see Schuck, 27 F.3d at 196-97. But these exceptions are exactly that: exceptions to the general rule that remand orders are not final and appealable.
 In the end, nothing in this case turns on whether we exercise jurisdiction over the remand order. Either way, the parties will return to arbitration to clarify the award. And regardless, this panel must follow our binding precedent on the issue. But in a future case, I would encourage our court to take another look at our precedent in this area.
