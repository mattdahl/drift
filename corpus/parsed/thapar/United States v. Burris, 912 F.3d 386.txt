, concurring. After leading police on a high-speed chase, Le'Ardrus Burris rammed his vehicle into a police officer, "throwing him backwards for 15 feet." R. 496, Pg. ID 3684. As a result of this action, an Ohio jury convicted Burris of felonious assault. A casual reader of today's decision might struggle to understand why we are even debating if ramming a vehicle into a police officer is a crime of violence. The reader's struggle would be understandable. The time has come to dispose of the long-baffling categorical approach. My colleagues have repeatedly said as much, and I urge any frustrated readers of today's decision—particularly Congress or the Sentencing Commission—to read and heed their words. See, e.g., Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2266-71, 195 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2018) (Alito, J., dissenting); Cradler v. United States, 891 F.3d 659, 672 (6th Cir. 2018) (Kethledge, J., concurring); United States v. Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d 1201, 1210-11 (9th Cir. 2017) (O'Scannlain, J., specially concurring); United States v. Davis, 875 F.3d 592, 595, 604 (11th Cir. 2017) (Ed Carnes, C.J.); United States v. Chapman, 866 F.3d 129, 136-39 (3d Cir. 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring); United States v. Faust, 853 F.3d 39, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2017) (Lynch, J., concurring); United States v. Tavares, 843 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2016) (Kayatta, J.); United States v. Doctor, 842 F.3d 306, 312-19 (4th Cir. 2016) (Wilkinson, J., concurring). I write to join them and to suggest a possible path forward.
As the jurists before me have explained, there are two big problems with the categorical approach. First, the categorical approach is an elements lottery that leads to arbitrary results. Second, it is very difficult to administer. Both problems are on display here.
 The elements lottery. Under the categorical approach, whether a prior state conviction qualifies as a crime of violence is a matter of chance that depends on how a state legislature and its judiciary have defined and interpreted the crime. This leads to some absurd results. For example, a North Carolina conviction for "knowingly discharging a firearm into an occupied building" or for raping a "mentally disabled person" is not a crime of violence.  Doctor, 842 F.3d at 315 (Wilkinson, J., concurring). In Florida, a conviction for attempted second degree murder is not a crime of violence, and in Oklahoma, a conviction for kidnapping is not. Id.
The absurd results are even more apparent in our circuit. As the majority opinion correctly notes, if you are in Cincinnati, Ohio, and you "cause serious physical harm to another," it is not a crime of violence. But if you drive one mile across the Ohio River and commit the very same crime in Kentucky, it is a crime of violence—all because the analogous statute in Kentucky defined serious physical harm a little differently. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 508.040; United States v. Maynard, 894 F.3d 773, 775 (6th Cir. 2018); United States v. Colbert, 525 F. App'x 364, 369-70 (6th Cir. 2013). So an increased sentence in this circuit turns not on whether a defendant's aggravated assault was actually violent, but on where the assault took place. In the future, those who have prior convictions for aggravated assault under subsection (A)(1) in Ohio will not be labeled a career offender, but those who have an identical conviction in Kentucky for the exact same conduct will be.
But the arbitrariness does not stop there. Each circuit decides for itself whether a crime qualifies as a crime of violence. For example, subsection (A)(1) of the Ohio felonious assault statute is no longer a crime of violence in this circuit, but it may still be a crime of violence in other circuits. United States v. Clark, 131 F. App'x 29, 30 (4th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). In other words, whether a defendant commits felonious assault in Ohio could matter less than where he commits a later crime. Id.; see also, e.g., United States v. Harris, 844 F.3d 1260, 1262 (10th Cir. 2017) (observing that of eleven circuits to have considered whether robbery is a "violent felony," five say no, and six say yes), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 1438, 200 L. Ed. 2d 716 (2018); compare United States v. Fluker, 891 F.3d 541, 549 (4th Cir. 2018) (holding that Georgia's robbery statute is indivisible and not a crime of violence), with United States v. Cooper, 689 F. App'x 901, 906-07 (11th Cir. 2017) (holding that Georgia's robbery statute is divisible and thus that robbery by sudden snatching is a crime of violence). So here again, geography matters more than actual violence under the categorical approach.
And yet arbitrariness abounds even within single states. In Ohio, subsection (A)(1) of the felonious and aggravated assault statutes is no longer a crime of violence, but subsection (A)(2) is. As the majority opinion properly explains, these subsections set forth separate but similar  crimes. Each prohibits knowingly causing physical harm to another. The difference is that subsection (A)(1) applies when the defendant caused serious physical harm, and subsection (A)(2), requiring only physical harm, applies when the defendant used a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance. Compare Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2903.11(A)(1), with id. § 2903.11 (A)(2). After today's decision, a person's prior conviction for felonious assault would not be a violent felony if he had caused the victim to have a seizure and a serious brain injury by violently striking her dozens of times with his fists. See State v. Perez, 2018-Ohio-1956, 2018 WL 2278169, at *1 (Ohio Ct. App. 2018). But if  he had instead caused a bruise on the victim's leg by striking her with a crowbar, it likely would be a violent felony. See State v. Smith, 2015-Ohio-1610, 2015 WL 1884222, at *2 (Ohio Ct. App. 2015). One must accept some level of arbitrariness with any law, but not the amount here, which a fact-based approach would avoid.
Administrative problems. The arbitrariness of the categorical approach ties in with its second flaw: the costs of administering the approach outweigh its benefits. Some initially thought that avoiding an inquiry into the facts of a prior conviction would be easier for judges. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 601, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990). And, to be sure, looking into the facts behind a prior conviction could be difficult in some cases where state records are unclear. This was particularly so in the pre-digital age in which the categorical approach emerged, when electronic filing was not commonplace. But whatever administrative difficulty a factual approach still hazards, the categorical approach ups the ante. By "simply swapp[ing] factual inquiries for an endless gauntlet of abstract legal questions," the categorical approach requires judges to throw away common sense. Doctor, 842 F.3d at 313 (Wilkinson, J., concurring); see Davis, 875 F.3d at 595. Each categorical-approach case (and there is no shortage of them) instead requires the judge to (1) mull through any number of hypothetical ways to commit a crime that have nothing to do with the facts of the prior conviction; (2) mine electronic databases for state court cases (precedential or not) depicting non-violent ways of commission; and (3) scrutinize those state court cases, some of which are old and predate the categorical approach, to determine their import. See Doctor, 842 F.3d at 313 (Wilkinson, J., concurring). Here, this meant that our court (1) considered hypothetical ways to feloniously assault someone without actually striking them, such as by exposing a child to his mother's dead body; (2) poured over countless Ohio Court of  Appeals decisions, some decades-old, e.g., State v. Elliott, 104 Ohio App. 3d 812, 663 N.E.2d 412 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995); and (3) tried to decide if one or two of those decisions, almost all involving violence, nevertheless demonstrate that Ohio felonious assault can be committed nonviolently. No judge who has engaged in this "Rube Goldberg jurisprudence" or traveled to this "pretend place" leaves thinking that life has been made easier. Davis, 875 F.3d at 595; Tavares, 843 F.3d at 19. And any judge who could end the matter upon finding that a defendant actually committed a violent act would find that task more administrable. This is particularly so when—as here—that question is undisputed.
In light of these problems, I join others in proposing an alternative approach. That approach would permit judges to deem a prior conviction a crime of violence if the underlying criminal conduct was actually violent. If the government can prove that the state court record establishes violent conduct, end the inquiry there. See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2269-70 (Alito, J., dissenting). If the government cannot, or if the record is insufficient to sustain the government's burden of proof, then the prior conviction does not count. See id. (Alito, J., dissenting).
I recognize that a fact-based approach is not without its own potential problems. Any difficulty in proving the facts underlying a past conviction would inure to the benefit of the defendant, meaning a defendant's career-offender status could turn not on the violence of his conduct, but on record-keeping. But it is incumbent on the government to keep good records whenever the government asks a court to put a defendant in prison, and it should be no  different here. United States v. Dupree, 323 F.3d 480, 491 (6th Cir. 2003) (observing that the government must prove whether a sentencing enhancement applies). And in the new world of electronic filing, many of the records will be readily available going forward. In addition, requiring sentencing courts to probe the facts underlying a conviction could pose Sixth Amendment problems, at least in the ACCA context. See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2259 (Thomas, J., concurring). But whatever the difficulty of those problems under the ACCA, the Sixth Amendment presents no obstacle under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. United States v. Sanders, 406 F. App'x 995, 997-98 (6th Cir. 2011); cf. Beckles v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 886, 892, 197 L. Ed. 2d 145 (2017) ("Unlike the ACCA, however, the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible range of sentences."). Therefore, Congress and the Sentencing Commission are well-positioned to make a change for  the better. I urge them to consider such a change so courts no longer have to "delve into pointless abstract questions" when determining whether striking a police officer with a car is a crime of violence. See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2268 (Alito, J., dissenting).
I respectfully concur.
  CONCURRING IN PART AND IN THE JUDGMENT
ROGERS, Circuit Judge. I concur in the result, and in the following parts of the lead opinion: Parts I and II, all but the last sentence of Part III.B, and Part III.C. For the reasons given by Judge Kethledge, we ought not address in this case whether United States v. Anderson, 695 F.3d 390 (6th Cir. 2012), was rightly decided. The problematic part of Anderson poses no problem for the defendant before the court. To resolve this appeal, we need only conclude that Ohio Rev. Code § 2903.11(A) is divisible and that § 2903.11(A)(2) describes a crime of violence under the Armed Career Criminal Act and the Guidelines. The lead opinion rightly resolves these issues, and I join the portions of the lead opinion that so hold. Burris was properly sentenced as a career offender.
