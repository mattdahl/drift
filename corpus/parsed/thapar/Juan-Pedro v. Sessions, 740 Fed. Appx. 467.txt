, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the majority that the Board did not take the full record into account before affirming the Immigration Judge's decision to deny the Juan-Pedros' asylum application. I part ways with the majority on what to do next. While the majority believes that we should make factual and credibility determinations on a cold record with no opportunity to observe the witnesses, I believe that we should leave that task to the Immigration Judge who saw and observed the witnesses and can better opine on things like credibility. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating that the Board itself is an appellate body, and can remand to the Immigration Judge for "further factfinding").
MS-13 is a ruthless gang. Maria Juan-Pedro ("Juan-Pedro") and her children know this firsthand. While living in Guatemala, MS-13 members broke into their home, raped Juan-Pedro, held the children at gunpoint, and stole the family's money. The attack was horrible, and the family fled to this country and sought asylum. But to successfully seek asylum they must demonstrate, among other things, that the attack happened "on account of" their "membership in a particular social group." 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); see Bonilla-Morales v. Holder, 607 F.3d 1132, 1136-37 (6th Cir. 2010) (upholding denial of asylum because of the failure to establish the required "nexus" between the alleged persecution and membership in a particular social group). In essence, they must show that their membership in that group caused the attack. On this point, Juan-Pedro's testimony was less than clear. Indeed, at different times during her testimony, she either said that she did not know why MS-13 came to her house or that they came to her house for money. But at no point, despite questioning from the government and the Immigration Judge, did Juan-Pedro say that MS-13 came to her house because of her family's ethnicity. The Immigration Judge found that this testimony failed to demonstrate that anything other than greed motivated MS-13, thus falling short of the required nexus for asylum. The Board affirmed. If Juan-Pedro only offered this testimony, the Board's (and, by incorporation, the Immigration Judge's) decision would have been reasonable.
But the record contained more than just Juan-Pedro's live testimony. As the majority points out, Juan-Pedro also submitted a pre-hearing affidavit in which she claimed that MS-13 attacked her family because of their ethnicity. The Board failed to consider this affidavit, and that is a flaw we may not overlook. See Mostafa v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 622, 625-26 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that the Board must consider the entire record); Daneshvar v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 615, 626 (6th Cir. 2004) (stating that this court may not presume that the Board considered evidence it did not mention). "Had the Board properly considered all evidence relevant to" MS-13's motivations, "it might have adjudicated [the] claim differently." Mostafa, 395 F.3d at 626 (emphasis added). Therefore, I agree that we must reverse.1 Id.
 I disagree, however, with the majority's decision to proceed further. The majority weighs the additional evidence itself and holds—in the first instance—that Juan-Pedro's affidavit in fact establishes the required nexus, despite her inconsistent statements at the hearing. If the record was so one-sided that no reasonable jurist could disagree, then the evidence would, in fact, "compel[] us" to so conclude. See Mandebvu v. Holder, 755 F.3d 417, 431 (6th Cir. 2014). Indeed in Mandebvu, the "record evidence," when considered as a whole, "reveal[ed] only one reason" for the petitioner's alleged persecution. Id. (emphasis added). But that is not this case. Here, while Juan-Pedro's pre-hearing affidavit attributed MS-13's actions to her heritage, her live testimony disclaimed any knowledge of MS-13's motivations other than greed. Thus Juan-Pedro provided two distinct reasons for MS-13's actions. While the Immigration Judge found Juan-Pedro's live testimony credible, the Immigration Judge apparently did not consider her affidavit. Maybe armed with that evidence, the Immigration Judge might reach a different outcome. Regardless, the Immigration Judge is in the best position to decide.
Only the fact-finder "can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener's understanding of and belief in what is said." Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985). And since fact-finders assess credibility so often, doing so becomes their bread and butter. See id. Courts of review, by contrast, lack this "special competence." Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 831, 850, 190 L. Ed. 2d 719 (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see, e.g., Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1474, 197 L. Ed. 2d 837 (2017) (redistricting) (deferring to the district court because "various cues . . . are lost on an appellate court later sifting through a paper record"); Agosto v. I.N.S., 436 U.S. 748, 757, 98 S. Ct. 2081, 56 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1978) (immigration) (remanding for a new hearing because "[i]t is only when the witnesses are present and subject to cross-examination that their credibility and the weight to be given their testimony can be appraised" (alteration in original) (quoting Poller v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962) (antitrust))).
As the Supreme Court has twice reminded our sister circuit, "the proper course" in cases like this one is to "remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation," and not to "conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed." Gonzales v. Thomas, 547 U.S. 183, 186, 126 S. Ct. 1613, 164 L. Ed. 2d 358 (2006) (per curiam) (quoting I.N.S. v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S. Ct. 353, 154 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2002)). The majority attempts to distinguish these precedents by pointing out that in both of these cases the Board did not consider an issue at all. By contrast, in this case, the Board considered the issue but did not take the entire record into account. This is a distinction without a difference.
Whether the Board failed to make a factual determination because they did not consider the legal issue or because they considered the issue but overlooked key evidence is of no matter. Finding facts is finding facts, regardless of the context. There is no reason to believe that a court of appeals is more capable in one situation over another. After all, in both situations, there are still facts to be found and credibility to be determined. If the Board did not consider evidence relevant to an issue,  then they need to consider it on remand before we do.
The Juan-Pedros' case requires that somebody make a credibility determination and find new facts in light of the ignored affidavit, or at the very least explain the discrepancy between that affidavit and the testimony. Consequently, we should heed the Supreme Court's advice and allow the fact-finder to be the one that reconciles Juan-Pedro's pre-hearing statements with her live testimony in the first instance. See Mostafa, 395 F.3d at 625-26 (remanding to the Board to consider record evidence its opinion did not mention).
Appellate panels are not made to fact-find. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to sidestep "the law's ordinary remand requirement." Ventura, 537 U.S. at 17.
