, concurring. In our adversarial system, parties don't just need to make the right arguments; they need to make the right arguments at the right time.
Bryan Mathis makes the right argument: he says that the police violated the Fourth Amendment when they searched his trash in violation of a local ordinance. Mathis concedes that this argument is foreclosed by precedent. See California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988). But in recent years, both judges and scholars have expressed serious doubts about that decision. See Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2266, 201 L. Ed. 2d 507 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting); Morgan v. Fairfield Cty., 903 F.3d 553, 570-71 (6th Cir. 2018) (Thapar, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); William Baude & James Y. Stern, The Positive Law Model of the Fourth Amendment, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 1821, 1881-82 (2016); see also Tanner M. Russo, Note, Garbage Pulls Under the Physical Trespass Test, 105 Va. L. Rev. 1217 (2019) (discussing how recent Supreme Court decisions may have narrowed or undermined Greenwood). And this might have been the case to see whether it remains good law.
The problem is that Mathis didn't make this argument at the right time: namely, in the district court. As a result, our court must review the argument for plain error. See United States v. Doxey, 833 F.3d 692, 702 (6th Cir. 2016). And the Supreme Court will likely not review it at all. Cf. Byrd v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1518, 1526-27, 200 L. Ed. 2d 805 (2018). In the end, that's unfortunate because forfeited arguments "do not serve the development of a sound or fully protective Fourth Amendment jurisprudence." Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2272 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).
Going forward, I urge parties to preserve arguments based on the text and history of the Fourth Amendment. This isn't a mere formality. There are still difficult questions to be answered about (among other things) what it means for a person to be "secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects" or what it means for a search to be "unreasonable." U.S. Const. amend. IV; see Morgan, 903 F.3d at 574-75 (Thapar, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (considering whether state property law, common law, or some other source of law should define these terms). And one of the basic premises of our legal system is that judges are better able to answer difficult questions when they do so with help from the parties at each level of the proceedings.
In short, there are arguments to be made; parties just need to make them in time.
