, concurring. I join the Majority's thoughtful opinion, as it faithfully applies current law. I write separately to comment on one aspect of the current law that I believe is both unnecessary to decide this case and inconsistent with the Constitution.
Under Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 113 S. Ct. 1913, 123 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1993), courts are instructed to defer to the Sentencing Commission when it interprets its own rules. The problem with that? "[J]ust as a pitcher cannot call his own balls and strikes, an agency cannot trespass upon the court's province to 'say what the law is."' United States v. Havis, 907 F.3d 439, 450 (6th Cir. 2018) (Thapar, J., concurring) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803)), vacated, 921 F.3d 628, on reh'g en banc, 929 F.3d 317 (6th Cir. 2019) (per curiam). Allowing an agency to interpret law—an exercise usually reserved for courts—does just that.
But make no mistake—this problem is not merely theoretical. Stinson, like all agency deference doctrines, creates real-world issues. That's because agencies have an incentive to make vague rules so they can later "interpret" those rules how they wish without following rulemaking requirements. Havis, 907 F.3d at 450 (Thapar, J., concurring). And agency deference should be even more troubling in a criminal case like this one, when personal liberty lies at stake. Id.
All the worse because we need not even apply Stinson in this case. Murphy's argument that the commentary undermines Congress's work cannot survive plain-error review even without deference to the guidelines. First, the supposedly conflicting statutory definition Murphy points to is wholly irrelevant. See Majority Op. at 9. Second, the commentary here does not purport to add to (or contradict) the text of the Guidelines, so it poses no problem under this circuit's precedent in Havis. Majority Op. at 10 (citing Havis, 927 F.3d at 386).
In sum, Stinson—and all the constitutional problems that accompany it—have no place here. I respectfully concur.
