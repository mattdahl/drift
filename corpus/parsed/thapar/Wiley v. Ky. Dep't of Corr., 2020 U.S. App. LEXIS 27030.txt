, dissenting. The Supreme Court recently reminded us that our job is not to "sally forth each day looking for wrongs to right." United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579, 206 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2020) (citation omitted). But here the majority does just that. I respectfully dissent.
I.
As Kentucky prisoner Allen Wiley tells it, he was simply waiting in line to go to dinner when five correctional officers assaulted him. He filed an internal grievance asking that the officers be fired. But that request violated the Kentucky Department of Corrections' rule against requests for specific disciplinary action. See Ky. Dep't of Corrs. Policies & Procedures 14.6 (II)(J)(1)(a)(9) ("An inmate filing a grievance concerning a staff member shall not suggest a specific form of disciplinary action."). The grievance was thus rejected.
Instead of amending his grievance to comply with the rule, Wiley went to court and sued the officers, the warden, and the Department of Corrections. See R. 22-1, Page ID 134 (instructing Wiley that he could "resubmit the grievance . . . once it is corrected on a new form within the guidelines of CPP 14.6"). Once in court, the defendants pointed out the obvious: Wiley had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 95, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006) (explaining that exhaustion requires compliance with the grievance system's "critical procedural rules"). So the district court correctly granted them summary judgment.
Inmates "are required to follow [prison] procedures to the letter." Risher v. Lappin, 639 F.3d 236, 241 (6th Cir. 2011). There are no "minimum standards" for these procedural rules. Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1858, 195 L. Ed. 2d 117 (2016); see Woodford, 548 U.S. at 85; Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524, 122 S. Ct. 983, 152 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2002). Whether or not we like them, we must respect them. And the Supreme Court has made clear that prisons, not the PLRA (or courts applying it), dictate inmate-grievance procedures. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007) ("[I]t is the prison's requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion."). Put simply, the prisons make the grievance-procedure rules; we just ask whether they were satisfied.
The only "exception" to this exhaustion requirement is when a grievance process is "unavailable"—that is, "incapable of use"—to a prisoner. Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1858-59. But this carveout does not help Wiley. His pro se brief (liberally construed) contains two related arguments for why he could not comply with the no-specific-action rule: (1) the grievance policies are kept in the prison's legal office and are not always available for examination; and (2) the grievance forms do not specifically recite the no-specific-action rule. See United States v. Kuehne, 547 F.3d 667, 693 n.10 (6th Cir. 2008) (affording a pro se appellate brief a liberal construction). Neither is compelling. As for the first, even the majority disregards it, rightly observing that there is no record evidence on point. See Maj. Order at 5 n.2. And as for the second, "[a] plaintiff's failure to exhaust cannot be excused by his ignorance of . . . the grievance policy"—or even by a reasonable misunderstanding of that policy. Napier v. Laurel Cty., 636 F.3d 218, 221 n.2 (6th Cir. 2011); see Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1858. It follows that a prisoner is not entitled to affirmative instruction on the correct method of filing a grievance. In short, neither of Wiley's arguments succeeds.
That should be the end of this case.
II.
But the majority holds that Wiley's claim can go forward. Why? The majority offers three rationales. None justifies reversal.
A.
The lead argument amounts to the untenable proposition that the prison was indeed required to affirmatively instruct Wiley about the no-specific-action rule. First, the majority suggests that Wiley may have lacked "a fair, reasonable opportunity to apprise himself of the procedures." Maj. Order at 5 (quoting Davis v. Hernandez, 798 F.3d 290, 295 (5th Cir. 2015)). Then, it cites Ross for the proposition that a prison's "failure to inform" an inmate of disqualifying procedural rules "may render the process so opaque as to be unavailable." Id. (citing Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859). Finally, it determines that this standard is met here because Wiley may have misconstrued the no-specific-action rule. Id. The takeaway: a prisoner cannot be required to follow a rule that the prison never affirmatively explained to him.
Ross says no such thing. There, the Court explained that administrative remedies are unavailable if a prison's procedures are "essentially unknowable," i.e., "so opaque" that "no ordinary prisoner can discern or navigate" them. Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859 (citation omitted). That stands in sharp contrast to the rationale for reversing here: Wiley might not have known, or might have failed to understand, the procedure. Compare Maj. Order at 5, with Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859 (stating that the "essentially unknowable" standard is "a significantly higher bar" than asking whether a rule was "sufficiently 'plain' as to preclude any reasonable mistake or debate").
Even on its own terms, the analysis is unpersuasive. Wiley had previously filed another grievance in which he requested removal of a nurse; it was rejected because asking to "[r]emove staff" was an "inappropriate action" to ask for. R. 22-1, Page ID 132. We are told that "in the light most favorable to Wiley," he might have thought that this statement from prison officials—you cannot ask to have staff removed—applied to nurses but not correctional officers. Maj. Order at 5. Based on what, exactly? This is just the kind of "metaphysical doubt" that should not preclude summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). More fundamentally, "[w]hen an administrative process is susceptible of multiple reasonable interpretations, Congress has determined that the inmate should err on the side of exhaustion." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859.
But that is not all. The Department not only told Wiley why his grievance was rejected, it explicitly invited him to try again. R. 22-1, Page ID 134; cf. George v. Seabold, 909 F.2d 157, 160 (6th Cir. 1990) (finding that a state prisoner had not exhausted state-court remedies because "the Kentucky Court of Appeals appears willing, in the interest of justice, to give defendant another chance" to seek relief). If this is a byzantine process, one wonders what doesn't amount to a "gotcha" trap for the average prisoner. Maj. Order at 6.
B.
The majority evidently believes that the previous argument is enough to reverse the district court. See Maj. Order at 5 ("Therefore, the Defendants have not met their [summary-judgment] burden . . . ."). Even so, it offers two additional theories for why the grievance process was unavailable: (1) the grievance form is unclear and thus creates a trap for the unwary prisoner; and (2) Wiley's grievance otherwise complied with Department rules. Id. at 6.
As for the grievance form's supposed lack of clarity, it was incumbent on Wiley to learn the rules and, when in doubt, to "err on the side of exhaustion." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859; Napier, 636 F.3d at 221 n.2. In any event, he was previously told that requesting staff be removed was sufficient grounds to reject a grievance; this is hardly the type of "machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation" designed to "thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1860; cf. Maj. Op. at 6. As for Wiley's partial compliance, this does not suffice under the PLRA. See Woodford, 548 U.S. at 93 (holding that "the PLRA exhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion"); Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1857 ("Time and again, this Court has . . . refus[ed] to add unwritten limits onto" the "rigorous textual requirements" of "mandatory exhaustion statutes like the PLRA."); cf. Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 108, 120 S. Ct. 2080, 147 L. Ed. 2d 80 (2000) (explaining that "courts reviewing agency action regularly ensure against the bypassing of [applicable exhaustion] requirement[s] by refusing to consider unexhausted issues"). The majority provides no contrary authority.
III.
Setting aside the merits of these two alternative theories, I would not consider them for the simple reason that Wiley never raised them. See, e.g., Geboy v. Brigano, 489 F.3d 752, 767 (6th Cir. 2007) (stating that even pro se appellants must fairly raise and develop arguments before this court). True, Wiley says he "made a good faith effort to try filing his grievance" and points out that the grievance form "does not advise the filer on what remedies to request." Appellant Br. at 4. But Wiley does not develop these bare-bones factual assertions into anything resembling the majority's legal arguments. He says nothing about the "interplay" of the grievance form and the no-specific-action rule. Maj. Order at 6. Nor does he complain that the rule is "troubl[ing]" or a "mere technicalit[y]" unworthy of this court's respect. Id. Just this year the Supreme Court warned lower courts against creating arguments for litigants who fail to raise them. See Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. at 1579. I would heed that warning.
I respectfully dissent.
