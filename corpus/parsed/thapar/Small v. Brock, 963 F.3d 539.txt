, dissenting. The allegations in this case are troubling. But the Constitution is not a one-size-fits-all remedy for every injury. And in fact, the Constitution and federal law often limit our authority to address certain injuries. Because that is the case here, I respectfully dissent.
Congress passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) in response to "a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts." Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006). The Act contains several provisions "designed to bring [prisoner] litigation under control." Id. It does so in part to help prisoners themselves: these provisions allow busy district courts to dismiss "nonmeritorious claims" so that they can focus on "the allegations with merit." Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 203, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007). Relevant here, one provision of the PLRA directs district courts to summarily dismiss any part of a complaint that "is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted," or that "seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief." 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1)-(2).
Following Congress's instructions, the district court dismissed Fletcher Small's complaint because it failed to state a claim. Small's complaint alleged that a prison guard had verbally threatened to kill him while waving a knife. And for this, he sought monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief based on the Eighth Amendment. The problem? The Constitution and the PLRA bar Small from pursuing each form of relief.
Monetary Relief. Start with Small's request for monetary relief. Again, the PLRA requires district courts to screen prisoner complaints and dismiss any part that (among other things) "fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted" or "seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief." Id. The district court dismissed Small's complaint because it failed to state a claim under the  Eighth Amendment. And as discussed below, that ruling was correct. But our court has an even more straightforward ground to affirm the  dismissal: the defendant in this case is "immune" from "monetary relief" under basic principles of qualified immunity.
Even before the passage of the PLRA, the Supreme Court recognized that courts could summarily dismiss prisoner complaints when the defendant was "immune from suit." Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989). Congress then expressly confirmed this principle in multiple provisions of the PLRA. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(2); see also id. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c)(1); Jones, 549 U.S. at 213-14. And our sister circuits have consistently found that these provisions include immunity from suit based on qualified immunity. See, e.g., Redmond v. Fulwood, 859 F.3d 11, 13, 429 U.S. App. D.C. 258 (D.C. Cir. 2017); Newland v. Reehorst, 328 F. App'x 788, 791 (3d Cir. 2009) (per curiam); Martin v. Duffy, 858 F.3d 239, 250-51 & n.3 (4th Cir. 2017); Story v. Foote, 782 F.3d 968, 969-70 (8th Cir. 2015); Chavez v. Robinson, 817 F.3d 1162, 1167-69 (9th Cir. 2016); Lee v. Waters, No. 98-6160, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 1531, 1999 WL 49149, at *2 (10th Cir. Feb. 4, 1999); Manzini v. Fla. Bar, 511 F. App'x 978, 983 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam).
To overcome qualified immunity—and thus the PLRA—Small must show (1) that his rights were violated and (2) that the violation was "clearly established at the time." District of Columbia v. Wesby, 138 S. Ct. 577, 589, 199 L. Ed. 2d 453 (2018) (cleaned up). These questions may be addressed in either order. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236-42, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009).
To begin with, Small can't show that his constitutional rights were violated. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has observed that "de minimis uses of physical force" generally are not covered by the Eighth Amendment. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 10, 112 S. Ct. 995, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992) (cleaned up); see Leary v. Livingston Cty., 528 F.3d 438, 443 (6th Cir. 2008) (Eighth Amendment claimant "must show something more than de minimis force"). If a prisoner usually cannot bring an Eighth Amendment claim for de minimis physical force, then a prisoner ought not be able to bring a claim when only threats are involved.
Circuit precedent points in the same direction. Our court has repeatedly held that threats or harassment, standing alone, do not amount to unconstitutional cruel-and-unusual punishment. See, e.g., Ivey v. Wilson, 832 F.2d 950, 954-55 (6th Cir. 1987) (per curiam); see also Williams v. Gobles, No. 99-1701, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8893, 2000 WL 571936, at *1 (6th Cir. May 1, 2000) (order) ("[N]either verbal  harassment nor threats constitute punishment within the context of the Eighth Amendment."). Other circuits have held the same. See, e.g., Gaut v. Sunn, 810 F.2d 923, 925 (9th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) ("[I]t trivializes the eighth amendment to believe a threat constitutes a constitutional wrong."); McFadden v. Lucas, 713 F.2d 143, 146 (5th Cir. 1983).
Indeed, in a prior knife-waving case, our circuit held that a cruel-and-unusual-punishment claim requires far more than the facts alleged here. See Parrish v. Johnson, 800 F.2d 600, 605 (6th Cir. 1986). There, the knife waving was only one of a series of inappropriate actions by an officer that in their "totality" amounted to a constitutional violation. Id. Those actions included (among others) making a paraplegic prisoner sit in his own feces, depriving him of food, and claiming to have infected his food with venereal disease. Id. at 603, 605. We held that it was "the type, number, and seriousness" of all these acts together that  rose to the level of cruel-and-unusual punishment. Id. at 605. And the differences between that case and this one speak for themselves.
But even if you doubted this precedent, there's little doubt that the alleged constitutional violation here wasn't clearly established and thus that the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity. The majority opinion acknowledges as much but still remands the case to the district court.
And for what purpose? Just so that the defendant can file a motion to dismiss, which the district court will (almost certainly) grant and our court will (almost certainly) affirm. Wouldn't these resources be better spent in state court? If his allegations are true, Small likely could pursue multiple claims under Michigan law. See, e.g., Espinoza v. Thomas, 189 Mich. App. 110, 472 N.W.2d 16, 21 (Mich. Ct. App. 1991) (defining assault); Roberts v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 422 Mich. 594, 374 N.W. 2d 905, 908-09 (Mich. 1985) (defining intentional infliction of emotional distress). But instead, our court sends him on his way to pursue a quixotic lawsuit in federal court. I would spare him a pointless journey.
The majority justifies this outcome in two ways.
 First, the majority adopts the following test from the Ninth Circuit: a district court may dismiss a prisoner complaint based on qualified immunity "only if it is clear from the complaint that the plaintiff can present no evidence that could overcome a defense of qualified immunity." Chavez, 817 F.3d at 1169. Where does this test come from? If you trace it back to its source, it originates from a case in which the Supreme Court concluded that a pro se complaint should not be dismissed unless "it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief." Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972) (per curiam) (cleaned up). If that test sounds familiar, it should. It's the general pleading standard announced in the infamous case of Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). But the problem is that the Supreme Court more recently retired Conley's "no set of facts" test and told us that a complaint must allege facts that state a "plausible" claim for relief. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 559-63, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). And even though pro se complaints are liberally construed, our court has refused to "abrogate basic pleading essentials in pro se suits." Wells v. Brown, 891 F.2d 591, 594 (6th Cir. 1989). Indeed, it's hard to see our court could have done otherwise given that the operative language in the PLRA mirrors the language in Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Compare 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1), with Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2); see Hill v. Lappin, 630 F.3d 468, 470-71 (6th Cir. 2010). So in the end, the majority's new test resurrects bad law in defiance of the Supreme Court, our court, and Congress. See, e.g., Twombly, 550 U.S. at 561 (rejecting notion that a claim would survive a motion to dismiss "whenever the pleadings left open the possibility that a plaintiff might later establish some set of undisclosed facts to support recovery" (cleaned up)); Martin v. Overton, 391 F.3d 710, 714 (6th Cir. 2004) ("[L]iberal construction does not require a court to conjure allegations on a [pro se] litigant's behalf." (cleaned up)). That's especially unfortunate here given that the defendant never even had an opportunity to weigh in on this issue before our court resolved it against him.
Second, the majority notes that Small has a "non-frivolous argument" that the alleged violation in this case was clearly established based on out-of-circuit precedent. But the PLRA doesn't just bar "frivolous"  claims; it bars all claims that "fail[] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted" or "seek[] monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief." 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b). And in any event, Small's argument seems pretty frivolous. See, e.g., Ashford v. Raby, 951 F.3d 798, 804 (6th Cir. 2020) (explaining that out-of-circuit decisions will  provide clearly established law only in "extraordinary cases where [they] both point unmistakably to a holding and are so clearly foreshadowed by applicable direct authority as to leave no doubt regarding that holding" (cleaned up)). So this point does nothing more to save Small's complaint.
Declaratory Relief. Consider next Small's request for declaratory relief. He asks us to declare the defendant's behavior unlawful under the Eighth Amendment. But the problem is that Small lacks standing to pursue this relief. "The fact that a harm occurred in the past does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that it will occur in the future"—as is required to establish standing for declaratory relief. Kanuszewski v. Mich. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 927 F.3d 396, 406 (6th Cir. 2019) (cleaned up). And Small has alleged nothing that would show the "immediacy and reality" that such harms will reoccur. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 104, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983) (cleaned up).
Indeed, Small alleges that the defendant threatened him while waving a knife once in December 2018 and a second time in February 2019. (He also makes a vague reference to "another threaten[ing] and intimidating behavior" around the same time. R. 1, Pg. ID 3.) Yet Small did not file his complaint until months later (in May) and did not allege that any further incidents occurred in the interim. Nor has he offered any reason to think that further incidents will occur in the future. Given all this, Small hasn't shown that he has standing to pursue prospective relief for an entirely hypothetical future harm (though he does have standing to pursue monetary relief for a "completed harm"). Kanuszewski, 927 F.3d at 407-08. In short, our court should dismiss this request for lack of jurisdiction.
Injunctive Relief. Finally, take Small's request for injunctive relief. Small asks us to issue an injunction ordering the defendant to "not be around [him] for any reason." R. 1, Pg. ID 4. But no principle of law entitles Small to such a broad remedy. Certainly, the defendant in this case does not violate the Eighth Amendment every time he's "around" Small—the defendant's prior behavior notwithstanding. Cf. Hudson, 503 U.S. at 9-10. And Small's request also conflicts with basic principles of equity. "Precisely because equitable relief is an extraordinary remedy," our court has recognized, "it follows that the scope of relief should be strictly tailored  to accomplish only that which the situation specifically requires." Sharpe v. Cureton, 319 F.3d 259, 273 (6th Cir. 2003) (cleaned up). The proposed injunction does not satisfy this requirement.
On top of all that, Small's request runs headfirst into the PLRA, which requires that any "[p]rospective relief . . . with respect to prison conditions . . . [be] narrowly drawn, extend[] no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and [be] the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right." 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A); see also Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 523-532, 122 S. Ct. 983, 152 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2002) (holding that the phrase "prison conditions" in another provision of the PLRA applies to individual claims of excessive force under the Eighth Amendment); Freeman v. Francis, 196 F.3d 641, 643-44 (6th Cir. 1999) (concluding that the  phrase has the same meaning across the PLRA and covers individual claims of excessive force). The Act also requires courts to "give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief." 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A). Together, these provisions (like others) are designed "to eliminate unwarranted federal-court interference with the administration of prisons." Woodford, 548 U.S. at 93. Yet Small's request asks us to do exactly what the PLRA prohibits: micromanage a prison. That we may not do.
***
It's often said that hard cases make bad law. This case proves the truth of that adage. Both the Constitution and federal law limit our authority to grant a remedy to this plaintiff—no matter how sympathetic we might find his allegations. Because I would heed those limits, I respectfully dissent.
