Like doctors, judges should follow the maxim "first, do no harm." Three days ago, the district court broadly enjoined an executive order from the Governor of Tennessee meant to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The court reasoned that this order violates the right of women in Tennessee to obtain a pre-viability abortion. But in doing so, the court made two critical errors: (1) it failed to point to specific evidence that a temporary delay would deprive any woman of her right to obtain an abortion, and (2) it failed to apply (or even acknowledge) Supreme Court precedent "governing emergency exercises of state authority during a public health crisis." In re Abbott, No. 20-50264, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 10893, 2020 WL 1685929, at *5 (5th Cir. Apr. 7, 2020) (citing Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S. Ct. 358, 49 L. Ed. 643 (1905)). And while we take time to review this case, the district court's injunction places lives in jeopardy. Given these serious concerns, I would grant the State's request for a temporary administrative stay pending our review of its stay motion.
