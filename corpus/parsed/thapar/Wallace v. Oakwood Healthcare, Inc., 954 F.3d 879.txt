, concurring. It is troubling to have no better reason for a rule of law than that the courts made it up for policy reasons. Yet that seems to be the case with ERISA's exhaustion requirement. Federal courts should reconsider when—or even whether—it's legitimate to apply this judge-made doctrine.
Here are some (hopefully uncontroversial) first principles. Congress, not the judiciary, has the power to "prescribe[] the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated." The Federalist No. 78, at 523 (Alexander Hamilton) (J. Cooke ed., 1961). Congress exercises this power by enacting texts, which become our laws. Outside of legislation, people can also change their rights and duties by making contracts. But when courts stray from the texts of these laws or the terms of these contracts, they wield power that is not rightly theirs.
It's hard to square these principles with the ERISA exhaustion doctrine. Or at the very least, with the way courts talk about the doctrine. One circuit has described it as "a judicial innovation fashioned with an eye toward 'sound policy.'" Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Price, 501 F.3d 271, 279 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Amato v. Bernard, 618 F.2d 559, 567 (9th Cir. 1980)). Another has said it's "a court-imposed, policy-based requirement." Watts v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 316 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir. 2003). But employees' benefit rights should not depend on "a hazy body of policy choices that courts are free to 'discover.'" Island Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 746 (6th Cir. 2019). They should just depend on (1) the statute Congress enacted and (2) the plan documents they or their employers agreed to.
We know this not only from first principles but also because Congress said so. ERISA gives an employee a federal cause of action "to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan." 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). As the text makes triply plain, this kind of claim "stands or falls by 'the terms of the plan.'" Kennedy v. Plan Adm'r for DuPont  Sav. & Inv. Plan, 555 U.S. 285, 300, 129 S. Ct. 865, 172 L. Ed. 2d 662 (2009). The statute is the procedural scaffolding, the plan documents the source of substantive rights.
Where does exhaustion enter this picture? The statute itself is "silent" about it. Coomer v. Bethesda Hosp., Inc., 370 F.3d 499, 504 (6th Cir. 2004). ERISA requires plans to offer fair and reasonable internal-review procedures for claims they deny. 29 U.S.C. § 1133(2). But the statute nowhere says claimants must take advantage of those procedures as a precondition to enforcing their rights in court.
 Even so, the circuit courts have "uniformly" enforced an exhaustion defense. Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 571 U.S. 99, 105, 134 S. Ct. 604, 187 L. Ed. 2d 529 (2013). The doctrine got its start back in an era of unabashed purposivism, and the two leading cases show it. They based the exhaustion requirement mainly on policy judgments, legislative-history tea-reading, and an unexplained analogy to the Taft-Hartley Labor Management Relations Act. See Amato, 618 F.2d at 566-68; Taylor v. Bakery & Confectionary Union & Indus. Int'l Welfare Fund, 455 F. Supp. 816, 819-20 (E.D.N.C. 1978). It should bother us that such a ubiquitous doctrine, one that has thwarted many an employee's efforts to enforce his benefit rights, rests on such shaky foundations. Maybe there are better arguments waiting to be made. But if there are, they've been waiting a long time.
Of course, even if the statute doesn't require exhaustion, a plan's documents may require it as a precondition of going to court. But sometimes they don't. Here, for example, the Reliance Policy not only fails to mention an exhaustion requirement but also fails to describe internal-review procedures at all. Reading this policy, it's hard to see what would put an employee on notice that she could lose her benefit rights by failing to appeal the denial of her claim. Where both the statute and the plan documents are silent about any duty to exhaust, we should think twice about whether requiring exhaustion is legitimate.
Because the majority opinion faithfully applies existing law, I join it in full.
