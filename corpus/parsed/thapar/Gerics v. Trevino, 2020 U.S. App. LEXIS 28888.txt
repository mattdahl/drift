, concurring. One question in this case is whether a judge or jury should decide the ultimate existence of probable cause for claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Precedent and history seem to point toward a common answer.
Start with precedent. In Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 116 S. Ct. 1657, 134 L. Ed. 2d 911 (1996), the Supreme Court held that the ultimate determination of probable cause presents a mixed question of law and fact, which appellate courts should review de novo, see id. at 696, 699. It naturally follows from that holding that judges—not juries—should decide whether probable cause exists when the underlying facts are undisputed. It's true that Ornelas involved a suppression dispute, not a civil claim under § 1983. But nothing in that case or later Supreme Court cases supports drawing such a distinction. See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93, 98 n.1, 125 S. Ct. 1465, 161 L. Ed. 2d 299 (2005); Jones v. Clark Cnty., 959 F.3d 748, 776 (6th Cir. 2020) (Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). So based just on Ornelas, I think a lower court—bound as we are by Supreme Court precedent—could answer the question here.
History points toward the same answer. The leading case on this question appears to be Johnstone v. Sutton, (1786) 99 Eng. Rep. 1225 (K.B.). That case began in a somewhat dramatic fashion: with a naval battle off the coast of West Africa in the early 1780s. A mishap during the battle resulted in years of litigation that became "a cause célèbre in naval and political circles." JP van Niekerk, Of Naval Courts Martial and Prize Claims: Some Legal Consequences of Commodore Johnstone's Secret Mission to the Cape of Good Hope and the "Battle" of Saldanha Bay, 1781 (Part 1), 21 Fundamina 392, 433 (2015). But eventually, the case reached the Exchequer Chamber, which issued a straightforward decision. Relevant here, the court explained that probable cause "is a mixed proposition of law and fact" and that, when the underlying facts are undisputed, probable cause presents a "question of law" for courts to decide. Johnstone, 99 Eng. Rep. at 1244-45. And based on the factual record before it, the court held that the defendant had probable cause and thus that the plaintiff could not prevail on his malicious-prosecution claim. See id. at 99 Eng. Rep. at 1244-45; Niekerk, supra, at 440-41. The clear takeaway from Johnstone is that judges—not juries—decide whether there's probable cause under a given set of facts.
Nor were matters different across the Atlantic. Many early American cases announced the same rule. Justice Story put it well:
What constitutes probable cause for seizure is, when the facts are given, a mere question of law, on which the court ought to instruct the jury. It is not a mere question of fact, of which the jury are the sole judges; and, therefore, the court are bound to direct the jury, whether upon the facts, there be probable cause or not.
U.S. v. Gay, 25 F. Cas. 1270, 1270, F. Cas. No. 15193 (C.C.D. Mass. 1815). Other cases to a similar effect are legion. See, e.g., Murray v. McLane, 1 Del. Cas. 534, 535-36 (C.C.D. Del. 1815) (per curiam); Munns v. De Nemours, 17 F. Cas. 993, 995-96, F. Cas. No. 9926 (C.C.D. Pa. 1811) (Washington, J.); Stone v. Crocker, 41 Mass. 81, 24 Pick. 81, 84-85 (Mass. 1832); Legget v. Blount, 4 N.C. 560, 561, 1 N.C. (Taylor) 123, N.C. (Taylor) 123 (1817); Thomas v. Rouse, 4 S.C.L. 75, 75 (S.C. Const. App. 1806). And many of these cases relied specifically on Johnstone for this rule. See, e.g., McCormick v. Sisson, 7 Cow. 715, 717 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1827); Nash v. Orr, 5 S.C.L. 94, 94 (S.C. Const. App. 1812). Thus, nearly a century after Johnstone, the Supreme Court could invoke that "celebrated case" as laying down the rule that judges—not juries—decide the ultimate existence of probable cause. Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U.S. 187, 194, 25 L. Ed. 116 (1878).
Perhaps the rule was so readily accepted because it simply made explicit a longer standing practice of judicial supervision at common law. See James Bradley Thayer, A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law 223-24, 228-30 (1898); Note, Reasonable and Probable Cause in Malicious Prosecution: For Judge or Jury?, 20 Colum. L. Rev. 897, 898 & n.6 (1920). And that practice in turn was grounded in sound practical concerns: namely, to prevent lawsuits from discouraging the enforcement of the law. See 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Law of England *126; Thayer, supra, at 230. But whatever the reason, it appears that "few, if any, rules of the common law rest upon a greater unanimity or strength of authority." Burton v. St. Paul, M. & M. R. Co., 33 Minn. 189, 22 N.W. 300, 301 (Minn. 1885).
 It's true that at least one early case might have suggested a different rule—albeit without any explanation or context. See Money v. Leach, (1765) 96 Eng. Rep. 320, 323 (K.B.) ("What is a probable cause of suspicion, and what is a reasonable time of detainer, are matters of fact to be determined by a jury."). But the same judge who wrote that opinion, Lord Mansfield, later made clear that probable cause is a question for judges when the facts are undisputed. See Johnstone, 99 Eng. Rep. at 1244-45. And later cases both in England and America treated this latter view as the well-established rule. See, e.g., Panton v. Williams, (1841) 114 Eng. Rep. 66, 75-76 (Q.B.); Stewart, 98 U.S. at 194.
Given all this—and without any direct evidence to the contrary—I'm satisfied that Ornelas not only binds us as a legal matter but also rightly resolved this question as a historical matter. Since our court adopts the correct position today, I join the majority opinion.
