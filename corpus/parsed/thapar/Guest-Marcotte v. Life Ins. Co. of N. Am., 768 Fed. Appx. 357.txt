, dissenting. As a court of appeals, our main task is to review district courts. Standards of review are instructions for that task. These standards can operate as barriers (plain error), they can operate to cabin our review (abuse of discretion), or they can give us permission to take a fresh look (de novo). In the world of abuse of discretion, we do not review the district court to see if we agree with its result; rather, we simply look at whether the court exercised its discretion in a permissible manner. We may reverse only if we have a "definite and firm conviction" that the district court "made a clear error of judgment." Foltice v. Guardsman Prods., Inc., 98 F.3d 933, 939 (6th Cir. 1996).
In this case, the district court thoughtfully reviewed the ERISA plaintiff's request for attorney's fees. After balancing the required factors, the district court determined that fees were not warranted. Because the district court's decision did not reflect a clear error of judgment, I respectfully dissent.
We have the abuse-of-discretion standard for two fundamental reasons. First, district courts need broad leeway to make litigation-management decisions. District courts make countless discretionary calls in every case. If we were to review each one de novo, the wheels of justice would come to a halt. And even if we were somehow  capable of reviewing each decision, we are not well-positioned to do so. While appellate courts get a snapshot of litigation, district courts live with cases from beginning to end. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 404, 110 S. Ct. 2447, 110 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1990). District courts get to know the lawyers, the parties, and the issues in a way a court of appeals never can. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 559-60, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988). We review cold records. They interact with real people. Thus, the abuse-of-discretion standard gives the district court the leeway it both deserves and needs to manage its cases.
Second, district courts' factual findings deserve deference. District courts find facts every day, and with that experience comes expertise. See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574-75, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985). This fact-finding expertise also applies to questions that require weighing several discrete facts together and drawing an overall conclusion from the whole—questions that are deeply case-specific. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n ex rel. CWCapital Asset Mgmt. LLC v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC, 138 S. Ct. 960, 967-68, 200 L. Ed. 2d 218 (2018). Though appellate courts have certain advantages because they are armed with more time and a panel of judges, those assets do not equip them to make discretionary calls from a cold factual record. Thus, for case-specific factual questions, appellate courts should not attempt to redo district courts' hard work by reviewing de novo—either in principle or in practice. See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574-75.
Both principles apply here. To start with, Congress commands we defer: the ERISA statute says that "the [district] court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney's fee." 29 U.S.C. § 1132(g) (emphasis added); see also Pierce, 487 U.S. at 558. As long as the plaintiff has shown "some success on the merits" (an element not in dispute here), the district court has "broad discretion" to award, or not award, attorney's fees. Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 254-55, 130 S. Ct. 2149, 176 L. Ed. 2d 998 (2010). This court has set out five factors to guide district courts in exercising that discretion:
(1) the degree of the opposing party's culpability or bad faith; (2) the opposing party's ability to satisfy an award of attorney's fees; (3) the deterrent effect of an award on other persons under similar circumstances; (4) whether the party requesting fees sought to confer a common benefit on all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or resolve significant legal questions regarding ERISA; and (5) the relative merits of the parties' positions.
Sec'y of Dep't of Labor v. King, 775 F.2d 666, 669 (6th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). These factors are not strict requirements; rather, they are "simply considerations representing a flexible approach." First Tr. Corp. v. Bryant, 410 F.3d 842, 851 (6th Cir. 2005); see also Hardt, 560 U.S. at 254-55, 255 n.8. Indeed, most of the factors are questions of degree that cannot even be answered "yes" or "no." Thus, the decision to award attorney's fees in an ERISA case (1) involves the management of litigation (attorney's fee awards); (2) is fact-dependent (most of the King factors are questions of fact); and (3) is made through a flexible multi-factored test (weighing the five King factors together and drawing a conclusion from the whole). In short, this is a model case for deferential appellate review.
Accordingly, we apply abuse-of-discretion review to the district court's factor-by-factor conclusions and to its ultimate  weighing of those factors. See Hoover v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 290 F.3d 801, 810 (6th Cir. 2002). Of course, if the district court makes a legal error, it necessarily abuses its discretion—we do not defer to a district court's erroneous interpretation of the law. But the scope of that rule is limited. For instance, it is a legal error when the district court misunderstands what the King factors mean or does not apply them at all. See, e.g., Gaeth v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 538 F.3d 524, 531-34 (6th Cir. 2008); see also Lakeridge, 138 S. Ct. at 968 n.7. It is not a legal error when we simply disagree with how the district court applied the King factors to the facts of the case. Otherwise, the legal-error exception would swallow up the rule and "abuse-of-discretion" deference would be meaningless.
When, as here, a district court thoroughly and thoughtfully applies the King factors to the facts of the case, it does not abuse its discretion. A short review of the district court's analysis proves the point.
Degree of culpability. The first King factor is "the degree of the opposing party's culpability or bad faith." 775 F.2d at 669. An ERISA defendant is not necessarily "culpable" because it made the wrong decision or even an "arbitrary and capricious" decision—some sort of deliberate misconduct is required. See Moon v. Unum Provident Corp., 461 F.3d 639, 643 (6th Cir. 2006) (per curiam). A defendant is culpable if it selectively reviewed the medical record or relied on incompetent/biased medical evidence but generally is not culpable if it simply misinterpreted the plan's requirements. See id. at 643-44; see also Shelby Cty. Health Care Corp. v. Majestic Star Casino, LLC, 581 F.3d 355, 377 (6th Cir. 2009). Here, the district court found the latter; the plan administrator thoroughly reviewed Guest-Marcotte's evidence but misinterpreted the plan. Specifically, the plan administrator thought that under the plan, Guest-Marcotte had the burden to show objective evidence of a "functional impairment"—i.e., evidence that she could no longer perform her (relatively sedentary) job. R. 88, Pg. ID 3183-84. Based on that misinterpretation of the plan's requirements, the administrator concluded that (1) it did not need to conduct a physical examination because Guest-Marcotte had the burden of proof, and (2) her evidence of pain did not meet that burden, no matter how compelling and voluminous it was, because it did not directly speak to her ability to perform her job. In a sense, Guest-Marcotte and the plan administrator were talking past each other. Unlike some of this circuit's previous decisions, the plan administrator thoroughly (rather than selectively or biasedly) reviewed all of plaintiff's evidence, and the plan administrator's denial relied on a misinterpretation of the plan. Contra Moon, 461 F.3d at 643-44; Gaeth, 538 F.3d at 530-31. Thus, the district court reasonably concluded that the plan administrator was not culpable. Even if we might view the facts differently in the first instance, the district court's conclusion was not a "clear error of judgment." Foltice, 98 F.3d at 939. So the district court did not abuse its discretion.1 
Ability to satisfy a fee award. The second King factor is "the opposing party's  ability to satisfy an award of attorney's fees." 775 F.2d at 669. The district court correctly found that this factor is not in dispute because the Defendants can satisfy a fee award.
Deterrent effect. The third King factor is "the deterrent effect of an award on other persons under similar circumstances." Id. The district court concluded that an award would not have a deterrent effect for two reasons. First, as the district court correctly observed, this factor "generally go[es] hand-in-hand" with culpability. R. 88, Pg. ID 3185. That is because a potential fee award will make intentionally misbehaving plan administrators think twice but will not prevent unintentional mistakes. See Foltice, 98 F.3d at 937. As explained above, the district court reasonably concluded that the plan administrator made an interpretive mistake and therefore was not culpable. So an award of attorney's fees here would not have a significant deterrent effect in the future. Second, the deterrent effect is less when, as here, a plaintiff's victory depends on the "unique facts of [her] case." Shelby Cty., 581 F.3d at 377-78. Our prior decision in Guest-Marcotte's favor specifically distinguished her EDS Type III, which necessarily causes debilitating pain, from more common problems like "fibromyalgia or back pain[,]" which "can be difficult to diagnose objectively." See Guest-Marcotte v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 730 F. App'x 292, 302-03 (6th Cir. 2018). Because her disease necessarily causes "severe and chronic pain," she was not required to produce additional "evidence of how her pain impacted her ability to work." Id. at 303. Thus, the district court was within its discretion to conclude that an award of attorney's fees would not have a deterrent effect.
Common benefit or significant legal question. The fourth King factor is "whether the party requesting fees sought to confer a common benefit on all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or resolve significant legal questions regarding ERISA." 775 F.2d at 669. As the district court correctly emphasized, the question is whether Guest-Marcotte "sought to confer a common benefit or sought to resolve a significant legal question," not whether she ended up doing so. R. 88, Pg. ID 3186; see also Gaeth, 538 F.3d at 533. Guest-Marcotte's arguments before the district court (and still on appeal) focus on the results of her victory, not what she initially sought. So her arguments miss the point. In any event, Guest-Marcotte sued only on her own behalf; there is no evidence that any other plan participants are "in the same position" as her, and she did not seek to resolve a significant legal question. Shelby Cty., 581 F.3d at 378 (quoting Gaeth, 538 F.3d at 533). Thus, the district court reasonably concluded that this factor weighed against a fee award.
Relative merits of the parties' positions. The fifth King factor is "the relative merits of the parties' positions." 775 F.2d at 669. The district court correctly acknowledged that this factor weighs in favor of a fee award. Guest-Marcotte prevailed by overcoming the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard. That necessarily means her position was much more meritorious than Defendants' position. See, e.g., McKay v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 428 F. App'x 537, 546 (6th Cir. 2011).
In sum, the district court accurately described each King factor and reasonably applied each factor to the facts of the case. It concluded that three of the five factors weighed against awarding attorney's fees, and that one did not apply. While another judge could have come out differently, that is the nature of both balancing tests and  abuse-of-discretion review. Standard-like balancing tests (versus sharp legal rules) do not yield clear right and wrong answers. See Antonin Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1180-81 (1989) (explaining that, unlike rules, "totality of the circumstances" standards have "no single 'right' answer" and "[o]nly . . . at the margins can an appellate judge say that [such a] determination must come out the other way as a matter of law"). This inevitable disagreement does not make what the district court did an abuse of discretion—particularly since the court's conclusion was fact-laden and involved the management of the litigation in front of it.
Simply put, no clear error of judgment occurred here, so the district court's decision should stand. We should carefully adhere to standards of deference so that "abuse of discretion" does not become "de novo review clothed in deferential robes." Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 235, 111 S. Ct. 1217, 113 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1991) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted). I respectfully dissent.
