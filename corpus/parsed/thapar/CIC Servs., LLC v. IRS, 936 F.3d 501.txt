, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc. In this country, people should not have to risk prison time in order to challenge the lawfulness of government action. In this circuit, they now do. Because the law does not condone—let alone require—that result, I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.
Although the details at first may seem technical, this is a straightforward case. In 2016, the IRS issued so-called guidance requiring taxpayers and their advisers to report certain information to the agency. Failure to do so can result in significant civil penalties. 26 U.S.C. §§ 6707-6708. And a willful violation can result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment. Id. § 7203. Less than a year later, CIC Services sued the IRS, alleging that the agency had issued its guidance unlawfully. The question here is whether the Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that "no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person," applies to that suit. Id. § 7421(a).
 The Supreme Court, this circuit, and other circuits have all told us that the answer to that question is no. Take the Supreme Court. Recently, it interpreted the Tax Injunction Act, which generally uses words "in the same way" as the Anti-Injunction Act. Direct Mktg. Ass'n v. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 135 S. Ct. 1124, 1129, 191 L. Ed. 2d 97 (2015). That case had two holdings. First, the Court held that the terms "assessment" and "collection"—used in both Acts—do not refer to reporting requirements. Rather, such "information gathering" is distinct from and occurs before these other stages of the taxation process. Id. at 1129-31. Second, the Court held that the term "restrain"—also used in both Acts—means to "prohibit" or "stop." Id. at 1132 (internal quotation marks omitted). It did so because the term "'restrain' acts on a carefully selected list of technical terms" (e.g., "assessment" and "collection"), not "an all-encompassing term, like 'taxation.'" Id. To adopt a broader definition, the Court explained, would "defeat the precision of that list, as virtually any court action related to any phase of taxation" could "inhibit" tax collection. Id. And the narrower definition appropriately reflected the term's "meaning in equity." Id. From these twin holdings, the Court easily concluded that a suit to enjoin a state law that required retailers to report certain  information to the state revenue service could not "be understood to 'restrain' the 'assessment' . . . or collection'" of a tax. Id. at 1133.
That conclusion nearly resolves this case. CIC filed its lawsuit to enjoin IRS "guidance" that required the company to report certain information to the agency. The company claimed that it would have to devote hundreds of hours of labor and tens of thousands of dollars to comply with that requirement. And for no good reason, the company said, because the IRS had issued its guidance in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Congressional Review Act. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 706, 801. Per the Supreme Court's direction, that suit cannot be understood to "restrain[] the assessment or collection" of a tax just because it might inhibit the agency's future collection efforts. 26 U.S.C. § 7421(a); Direct Mktg., 135 S. Ct. at 1133.
This case, however, does pose one additional wrinkle. Congress has prescribed civil penalties for failing to comply with certain IRS regulations and has apparently decided that these penalties should count as "taxes" for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. See 26 U.S.C. § 6671(a); Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 544-45, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 183 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2012). But that fact changes little. The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits "for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection" of a tax. 26 U.S.C. § 7421(a). And here the suit seeks to enjoin the underlying reporting requirement, not the penalties. Nor has the IRS otherwise shown that CIC has the "purpose" of restraining these penalties. The company complains about the costs of complying with the reporting requirement, not the potential penalties for failing to do so. Indeed, CIC currently has no "tax" liability under this regulatory regime and may never incur any such liability. Simply put, this is not a case about taxes. CIC Servs., LLC v. IRS, 925 F.3d 247, 259 (6th Cir. 2019) (Nalbandian, J., dissenting).
Our circuit has reached the same conclusion in a nearly identical case. Specifically, we held that the Anti-Injunction Act did not apply to a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, even though employers would have to pay a "tax" if they violated the mandate. See Autocam Corp. v. Sebelius, 730 F.3d 618, 621-22 (6th Cir. 2013), vacated on other grounds sub nom. Autocam Corp. v. Burwell, 573 U.S. 956, 134 S. Ct. 2901, 189  L. Ed. 2d 852 (2014). Our decision reasoned that the suit was "not intended to 'restrain[]' the IRS's efforts to 'assess[] or collect[]' taxes"; rather, it sought only to enjoin the underlying mandate. Id. at 622 (alterations in original). Although the  Supreme Court later vacated that decision, it did so on other grounds. So the decision continues to be entitled to (at the very least) persuasive weight. And there was no good reason to disturb it here. Cf. United States v. Adewani, 467 F.3d 1340, 1342 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 870 F.2d 1292, 1298 (7th Cir. 1989).
Our circuit was not alone in its conclusion. Two other circuits have reached the same result using the same reasoning. See Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 669-70 (7th Cir. 2013); Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1126-27 (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc). And another applied the same reasoning to a similar case. See Seven-Sky v. Holder, 661 F.3d 1, 8-10, 398 U.S. App. D.C. 134 (D.C. Cir. 2011), abrogated on other grounds by NFIB, 567 U.S. 519, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 183 L. Ed. 2d 450.
Finally, these decisions just make sense. After all, the Supreme Court has long presumed that parties may challenge agency action before they suffer any harm. See, e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1815-16, 195 L. Ed. 2d 77 (2016); Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 139-41, 152-53, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967); United States v. Nourse, 34 U.S. 8, 28-29, 9 L. Ed. 31 (1835) (Marshall, C.J.). True, the Anti-Injunction Act creates a narrow exception to that rule. Yet the IRS's interpretation would not just broaden that exception but blast it wide open. In recent years, the agency has begun to regulate an ever-expanding sphere of everyday life—from childcare and charity to healthcare and the environment. That might be okay if the IRS followed basic rules of administrative law. But it doesn't. See Kristin E. Hickman & Gerald Kerska, Restoring the Lost Anti-Injunction Act, 103 Va. L. Rev. 1683, 1685, 1712-20 (2017). So with great power comes little accountability.
Even so, one might think, the IRS's interpretation would still allow people to bring a challenge after they violate the reporting requirement and pay the penalty. True enough. But only if people are also willing to spend up to a year in prison. See 26 U.S.C. § 7203. In effect, these criminal sanctions make the reporting requirement in this case (and many others) unreviewable. The IRS responds that "[it] is not clear" whether the government would criminally prosecute someone "who demonstrates a good-faith intent to submit its challenge for judicial resolution." IRS En Banc Br. at 8. But that has never been a "sufficient answer." Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 154 (rejecting the argument that "the threat of criminal sanctions" was "unrealistic"). Courts normally do not require people "to bet the farm" in order to bring an administrative challenge.  Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 490, 130 S. Ct. 3138, 177 L. Ed. 2d 706 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the IRS seems to think people should bet their liberty.
Going forward in this circuit, the IRS will have the power to impose sweeping "guidance" across areas of public and private life, backed by civil and criminal sanctions, and left unchecked by administrative or judicial process. Surely nobody in 1867 would have understood the Anti-Injunction Act to require such a result. See Pullan v. Kinsinger, 20 F. Cas. 44, 48, F. Cas. No. 11463 (C.C.S.D. Ohio 1870) (describing the Act as "wholly unnecessary, enacted only as a politic and kindly publication of an old and familiar [common law] rule"); Erin Morrow Hawley, The Equitable Anti-Injunction Act, 90  Notre Dame L. Rev. 81, 96-97 (2014). Nor should we have allowed it.
By this point, one might recognize the "elephant in the room." Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, 834 F.3d 1142, 1149 (10th Cir. 2016) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). The Founders gave Congress the "Power To lay and collect Taxes." U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. They limited this power to Congress because they understood full well that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy." M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 431, 4 L. Ed. 579 (1819) (Marshall, C.J.). But today, the IRS (an executive agency) exercises the power to tax and to destroy, in ways that the Founders never would have envisioned. E.g., In re United States (NorCal Tea Party Patriots), 817 F.3d 953 (6th Cir. 2016). Courts accepted this departure from constitutional principle on the promise that Congress would still constrain agency power through statutes like the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq. We now see what many feared: that promise is often illusory.
The IRS offers some arguments in response. It first contends that several Supreme Court decisions support its interpretation. Specifically, the agency points to Alexander v. "Americans United" Inc., 416 U.S. 752, 94 S. Ct. 2053, 40 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1974) and Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, 94 S. Ct. 2038, 40 L. Ed. 2d 496 (1974). In those cases, the Court held that the Anti-Injunction Act barred challenges to the IRS's decision to revoke the tax-exempt status of two nonprofits. The nonprofits each argued that their lawsuits sought only to maintain their flow of charitable donations, not to restrain a tax. But the Court recognized that the "primary" or "obvious purpose" of both lawsuits was to restrain the collection of taxes.  "Americans United," 416 U.S. at 760-61; Bob Jones, 416 U.S. at 738.1  Indeed, the plaintiffs in those cases were "defeated by [their] own pleadings, since the only injuries [they] identified involved tax liability." Seven-Sky, 661 F.3d at 10 (citing "Americans United," 416 U.S. at 761; Bob Jones, 416 U.S. at 738-39). Yet here CIC has a clear interest—separate from any potential "tax" liability—in avoiding the substantial costs of the reporting requirement. The "purpose" of its lawsuit is to obtain relief from costs the company must pay today, not to restrain a penalty it might have to pay tomorrow. The agency also cites NFIB, 567 U.S. 519, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 183 L. Ed. 2d 450. But that decision never reached the question whether the lawsuit had the "purpose of restraining" a tax because the penalty in that case was not a "tax." See id. at 546.2 
 Lastly, the IRS invokes a policy concern, asserting that any other interpretation would allow parties to circumvent the Anti-Injunction Act through "ingenious" pleading. IRS Br. at 43. But the agency has offered little basis for that concern. And the Supreme Court's decisions in "Americans United" and Bob Jones suggest that courts can determine a lawsuit's purpose without barring every pre-enforcement challenge involving the IRS (or requiring would-be plaintiffs to file their lawsuits from prison). More to the point, the Court has repeatedly told us that we may not rewrite a statute based on policy concerns. See, e.g., Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1815, 204 L. Ed. 2d 139 (2019). In sum, the Anti-Injunction Act should not apply to this suit.
 ***
The IRS has long "envision[ed] a world in which no challenge to its actions is ever outside the closed loop of its taxing authority." Cohen v. United States, 650 F.3d 717, 726, 397 U.S. App. D.C. 33 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc). With today's decision, I fear we have made some large strides towards such a world. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.
