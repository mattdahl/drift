, concurring. Given our limited review at this stage, I agree that we should grant Hall authorization to file a second-or-successive § 2255 motion. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h); In re Lott, 366 F.3d 431, 432-33 (6th Cir. 2004) (order). That seems especially appropriate here given that our court has previously granted two of his co-defendants authorization for similar claims. See In re Williamson, No. 19-6302, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 9380 at 4 (6th Cir. Mar. 25, 2020) (order); In re Wilson, No. 18-6058, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 4626 at 4 (6th Cir. Feb. 14, 2019) (order). That said, I have little doubt that Hall's motion will fail on the merits—either because the waiver in his plea agreement bars this collateral attack or because Tennessee first-degree murder is a "crime of violence" under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A) (or for both these reasons). And the fact that there's any uncertainty about the latter point—whether first-degree murder is a "crime of violence"—just goes to show the absurdity of the so-called "categorical approach." See, e.g., Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2266-71, 195 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2016) (Alito, J., dissenting); Lowe v. United States, 920 F.3d 414, 420 (6th Cir. 2019) (Thapar, J., concurring); United States v. Burris, 912 F.3d 386, 407-10 (6th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (Thapar, J., concurring). But until Congress or the Supreme Court tells us otherwise, we must continue to entertain such absurd possibilities.
For these reasons, I respectfully concur.
