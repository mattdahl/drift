, concurring in part. I agree that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. I would just reach that result through slightly different reasoning.
Pilot appealed from two separate orders entered by the district court. As the main opinion explains, the first order doesn't give us jurisdiction because it did not deny the company's motion to compel arbitration. See 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(B); Van Dusen v. Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d 893, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2016); Cont'l Cas. Co. v. Staffing Concepts, Inc., 538 F.3d 577, 580-81 (7th Cir. 2008). Rather, it merely ordered discovery on whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate in the first place—a process that the Federal Arbitration Act clearly contemplates. See 9 U.S.C. § 4.
Yet the second order (entered over four months later) did deny Pilot's motion to compel arbitration—albeit without prejudice. The main opinion reasons that this order doesn't give us jurisdiction because it was "purely ministerial" and "issued without prejudice." But several other circuits have suggested that any denial of a motion to compel arbitration—even a denial without prejudice—confers appellate jurisdiction under the Federal Arbitration Act. See, e.g., Microchip Tech. Inc. v. U.S. Philips Corp., 367 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Snowden v. CheckPoint Check Cashing, 290 F.3d 631, 635-36 (4th Cir. 2002); Sandvik AB v. Advent Int'l Corp., 220 F.3d 99, 102-04 (3d Cir. 2000); McLaughlin Gormley King Co. v. Terminix Int'l Co., 105 F.3d 1192, 1193 (8th Cir. 1997); cf. Colon v. R.K. Grace & Co., 358 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).
It might be possible to distinguish those cases (as the main opinion does). But I see no reason to reach the issue given that Pilot disclaimed that the second order "independently create[s] jurisdiction over this appeal." Reply Br. at 11-12 n.10. Although parties cannot waive arguments against jurisdiction, they are more than free to waive (or forfeit) arguments for it. See, e.g., Taylor v. KeyCorp, 680 F.3d 609, 615 n.5 (6th Cir. 2012); see also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, 937 F.3d 533, 542 (5th Cir. 2019); Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 618, 431 U.S. App. D.C. 3 (D.C. Cir. 2017); Blakley v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 648 F.3d 921, 931-32 (8th Cir.  2011); Raley v. Hyundai Motor Co., 642 F.3d 1271, 1275 (10th Cir. 2011) (Gorsuch, J.); Fothergill v. United States, 566 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir. 2009); Am. Vantage Cos. v. Table Mountain Rancheria, 292 F.3d 1091, 1101 (9th Cir. 2002); cf. Muscarello v. Ogle Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 610 F.3d 416, 425-26 (7th Cir. 2010). And given Pilot's briefing on the issue, I would leave matters at that.
For these reasons, I concur in Section B.i of the main opinion and in the judgment.
