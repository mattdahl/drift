, concurring. I concur in the thoughtful majority opinion, which correctly resolves the disputed issues before us. I write separately to offer a reminder that "malicious prosecution" is a troublesome label for claims based on unreasonable pretrial detention. As our court explained years ago, this cause of action is better characterized "simply as the right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from continued detention without probable cause." Gregory v. City of Louisville, 444 F.3d 725, 750 (6th Cir. 2006). In other words, it's "a plain-vanilla Fourth Amendment claim." Manuel v. City of Joliet, 903 F.3d 667, 670 (7th Cir. 2018) (Easterbrook, J.), on remand from 137 S. Ct. 911, 197 L. Ed. 2d 312 (2017).
While old habits can be hard to break, I encourage parties and judges in this circuit to follow the Supreme Court's lead in Manuel and "eschew[] the 'malicious prosecution' label." Pagán-González v. Moreno, 919 F.3d 582, 608 (1st Cir. 2019) (Barron, J., concurring) (discussing Manuel, 137 S. Ct. 911, 197 L. Ed. 2d 312); see also Jones v. Clark Cty., 959 F.3d 748, 777 (6th Cir. 2020) (Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that Manuel "conspicuously avoided that label"). The label serves little purpose and leads only to confusion.
If you doubt it, just look at this case. The police arrested Tlapanco pursuant to a warrant after a magistrate judge made a (possibly invalid) probable-cause determination. He was then held on that warrant throughout his detention. Thus, by all appearances, he suffered no more than one unreasonable seizure of his person. Logically, that one seizure should give rise to one Fourth Amendment claim. Yet Tlapanco brings two—a false-arrest-and-imprisonment claim and a "malicious prosecution" claim, both based on the same seizure and ensuing detention. The majority opinion properly accepts this presentation given that all parties litigated on this basis. Still, it's worth pointing out that the parties' presentation seems duplicative.
What explains this redundancy? If you study Tlapanco's pleadings, it's unclear whether he originally intended to bring the "malicious prosecution" count as a Fourth Amendment claim. Rather, he seems to have pled the false-arrest-and-imprisonment count to cover the Fourth Amendment injury of unreasonable seizure and detention and then to have proffered a "malicious prosecution" claim based on some independent constitutional right to be free from wrongful criminal charges.
But this court has not recognized a freestanding malicious-prosecution claim under due-process principles. Or at any rate, not since before Albright v. Oliver, which rejected a substantive-due-process right to be free from unreasonable prosecution. 510 U.S. 266, 268, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994); see also Spurlock v. Satterfield, 167 F.3d 995, 1006 (6th Cir. 1999) (discussing pre-Albright circuit precedent).
What this court has recognized—and repeatedly called "malicious prosecution," though often with reluctance—is a Fourth Amendment claim for unreasonable seizures related to prosecutions. See, e.g., Howse v. Hodous, 953 F.3d 402, 409 (6th Cir. 2020); Sykes v. Anderson, 625 F.3d 294, 310 (6th Cir. 2010); Gregory, 444 F.3d at 750; see also Jones, 959 F.3d at 777 (Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). As we have explained, "malicious prosecution" is a "misnomer" for this kind of claim for at least two reasons: (1) it has no separate "malice" element; and (2) since it's rooted in the Fourth Amendment, it targets the wrong of unreasonable detention, not the wrong of unjustified prosecution as such. Howse, 953 F.3d at 408-09. In other words, both the adjective and the noun in "malicious prosecution" are misleading.
Even so, the label has stuck and is now embedded in our caselaw. So you can hardly blame the parties for their initial assumption that Tlapanco could bring both a "malicious prosecution" claim and a false-arrest-and-imprisonment claim.1  Later, as the case proceeded, the parties read the fine print and shifted the "malicious prosecution" count onto a Fourth Amendment footing. But no one seemed to notice that this produced two Fourth Amendment claims for a single Fourth Amendment injury. To avoid this confusion in the future, we should stop calling it "malicious prosecution" when a plaintiff brings a Fourth Amendment claim based on unreasonable pretrial detention.
