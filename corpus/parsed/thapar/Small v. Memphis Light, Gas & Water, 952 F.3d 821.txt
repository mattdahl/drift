, concurring. Almost fifty years ago, Congress struck a balance between the rights of religious employees and the interests of their employers. According to that compromise, companies must accommodate religious practices and beliefs unless doing so would impose an "undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). To be sure, Congress codified this requirement "somewhat awkwardly" in Title VII's statutory definition of "religion." Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 63 n.1, 107 S. Ct. 367, 93 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1986). And Congress failed to specify exactly what it meant by "undue hardship." But most likely, everyone assumed that courts would clarify this standard over time, using the traditional tools of statutory interpretation.
So what do those tools tell us? Well, start with the text. Congress didn't define the term "undue hardship," so we should give that term its ordinary, contemporary meaning. See, e.g., Sandifer v. U.S. Steel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 227, 134 S. Ct. 870, 187 L. Ed. 2d 729 (2014). Dictionaries from the  period define a "hardship" as "adversity," "suffering" or "a thing hard to bear." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 601 (1969); Black's Law Dictionary 646 (5th ed. 1979); Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language 826 (2d ed. 1975). On its own terms, then, the word "hardship" would imply some pretty substantial costs.
But Congress didn't leave matters there. Instead, it specified that the "hardship" must be "undue." See, e.g., Adeyeye v. Heartland Sweeteners, LLC, 721 F.3d 444, 455 (7th Cir. 2013) ("Title VII requires proof not of minor inconveniences but of hardship, and 'undue' hardship at that."); Anderson v. Gen. Dynamics Convair Aerospace Div., 589 F.2d 397, 402 (9th Cir. 1978); Draper v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co., 527 F.2d 515, 520 (6th Cir. 1975). That means that the hardship must "exceed[] what is appropriate or normal"; in short, it must be "excessive." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1398; Black's Law Dictionary 1370; Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language 826. So together the phrase "undue hardship" tell us that the accommodation must impose significant costs on the company.
Not surprisingly, Congress has typically defined "undue hardship" in exactly this way. Take the Americans with Disabilities Act, which (like Title VII) requires companies to provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so would impose an "undue hardship" on their business. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). In that context, Congress defined an "undue hardship" as "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense" in light of certain enumerated factors (such as the size of the company). Id. § 12111(10). Nor does the meaning of "undue hardship" change if one ventures further afield in the United States Code. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1869(j) (explaining that an "undue hardship or extreme inconvenience" for jury service means "great distance . . . from the place of holding court," "grave illness in the family," or "any other emergency which outweighs in immediacy and urgency the obligation to serve as a juror"); 29 U.S.C. § 207(r)(3) (explaining that an "undue hardship" under the Fair Labor Standards Act means "significant difficulty or expense"); 38 U.S.C. § 4303(15) (explaining that an "undue hardship" for veteran employment means "significant difficulty or expense").
Or consider how courts define "undue hardship" when Congress has failed to provide a statutory definition. For instance, the Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to discharge a student loan if they can show that the debt imposes an "undue hardship." 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8). "The plain meaning" of that term, courts have said, requires the debtor to show that the debt imposes "intolerable difficulties . . . greater than the ordinary circumstances that might force one to seek bankruptcy relief." In re Thomas, 931 F.3d 449, 454 (5th Cir. 2019). Indeed, "the adjective 'undue' indicates that Congress viewed garden-variety hardship as [an] insufficient excuse[.]" In re Frushour, 433 F.3d 393, 399 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting In re Rifino, 245 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir. 2001)). And the same holds true when courts consider (or use) the phrase "undue hardship" in other contexts. See, e.g., Teamsters Local Union No. 171 v. N.L.R.B., 863 F.2d 946, 957, 274 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (explaining that an "undue hardship" requires "significant mitigating circumstances"); In re Int'l Sys. & Controls Corp. Sec. Litig., 693 F.2d 1235, 1241 (5th Cir. 1982) (explaining that an "undue hardship" might exist when there is an "unusual expense").
Given all this, one would think that the term "undue hardship" would have a similar meaning under Title VII. After all,  courts typically try "to make sense rather than nonsense out of the corpus juris." Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 101, 111 S. Ct. 1138, 113 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1991). But the Supreme Court has said otherwise.
The source of the problem is Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 97 S. Ct. 2264, 53 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1977). That decision primarily addressed whether Title VII's accommodation provision required employers to violate seniority systems created by their collective-bargaining agreements. See id. at 78-84. But in two brief paragraphs at the end of the opinion, the Court also asserted—almost as an afterthought—that requiring an employer "to bear more than a de minimis cost" in order to accommodate an employee's religion would be "an undue hardship." Id. at 84. The cost found to be more than de minimis: $150. Id. at 92 n.6 (Marshall, J., dissenting). And the employer unduly burdened by that cost: one of the largest airlines in the world.
At this point, you might be wondering where the "de minimis" test even came from? Certainly not the text of Title VII. The Hardison majority never purported to justify its test as a matter of ordinary meaning. And how could it? "De minimis" means a "very small or trifling matter[.]" Black's Law Dictionary 388. That seems like the opposite of an "undue hardship." See Hardison, 432 U.S. at 92 n.6 (Marshall, J., dissenting) ("I seriously question whether simple English usage permits 'undue hardship' to be interpreted to mean 'more than de minimis cost.'"). The "de minimis" test also seems in conflict with the background legal maxim de minimis non curat lex ("the law does not care for trifling matters"). Wisconsin Dep't of Revenue v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co., 505 U.S. 214, 231, 112 S. Ct. 2447, 120 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1992); Black's Law Dictionary 388. The law usually does not care for trifling matters but apparently Title VII does.
Nor can one blame the parties in Hardison. None of them proposed the "de minimis" test—and probably for good reason. In fact, most of their briefing focused on other issues in the case.
As best one can tell, the Hardison majority adopted the "de minimis" test for two reasons: one explicit and one implicit. As for the explicit reason, the majority said that religious accommodations that involved more than "de minimis" costs would cause employers to "discriminate" against their non-religious employees. See Hardison, 432 U.S. at 84-85. But that reasoning seems unreasonable on its face. Consider again the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires employers to provide accommodations to their disabled employees. No right-minded person would call such accommodations a form of impermissible discrimination against non-disabled employees. Cf. US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 397, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002); see also E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2034, 192 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015) ("But Title VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices—that they be treated no worse than other practices. Rather, it gives them favored treatment[.]").
As for the implicit reason—acknowledged only by the Hardison dissent—the majority may have construed Title VII so narrowly because it feared that a broader reading might run afoul of the Establishment Clause. See Hardison, 432 U.S. at 89-90 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Yet whatever doctrinal merit that concern once may have had, I seriously doubt that it remains valid. Even properly read, Title VII doesn't require employers to provide any and all accommodations; it requires them to provide only those accommodations that won't impose an "undue hardship" on the company—meaning significant costs. That seems more than fine under the Establishment Clause. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 722-24, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1020 (2005); Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703, 711-12, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring); Michael W. McConnell, Accommodation of Religion: An Update and a Response to the Critics, 60 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 685, 704 (1992); see generally Mark Storslee, Religious Accommodation, the Establishment Clause, and Third-Party Harm, 86 U. Chi. L. Rev. 871 (2019) (challenging the theory that religious accommodations violate the Establishment Clause whenever they impose more than de minimis costs).
In any event, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance doesn't give courts license to rewrite a statute. See, e.g., Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 836, 200 L. Ed. 2d 122 (2018). But the Hardison majority appears to have done exactly that. The only other explanation is that the majority stumbled through the looking glass and into "an Alice-in-Wonderland world where words have no meaning[.]" Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 354, 90 S. Ct. 1792, 26 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in the judgment).
Of course, all this does not mean that employers must always accommodate their employees' religious beliefs and practices. The term "undue hardship" makes clear "that this is a field of degrees, not a matter for extremes" or "absolutes." E.E.O.C. v. Firestone Fibers & Textiles Co., 515 F.3d 307, 313 (4th Cir. 2008); cf. Barnett, 535 U.S. at 402. But Hardison itself adopted an "absolute" when it "effectively nullifi[ed]" the accommodation requirement. Hardison, 432 U.S. at 89 (Marshall, J., dissenting). And without any real reason.
The irony (and tragedy) of decisions like Hardison is that they most often harm religious minorities—people who seek to worship their own God, in their own way, and on their own time. See McConnell, supra, at 693, 721-22; Storslee, supra, at 873-74, 877. The American story is one of religious pluralism. The Founders wrote that story into our Constitution in its very first amendment. And almost two-hundred years later, a new generation of leaders sought to continue that legacy in Title VII. But the Supreme Court soon thwarted their best efforts. Even at the time, this "ultimate tragedy" was clear. Hardison, 432 U.S. at 97 (Marshall, J., dissenting) ("[O]ne of this Nation's pillars of strength our hospitality to religious diversity has been seriously eroded.").
In the end, this case doesn't involve a challenge to the "de minimis" test. Indeed, Jason Small hasn't even contested—at least in a meaningful way—his employer's claim of "undue hardship." But litigants should consider such challenges going forward. See Patterson v. Walgreen Co., 140 S. Ct. 685, 206 L. Ed. 2d 230 (2020) (Alito, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari). As the Hardison dissent explained, "All Americans will be a little poorer until [the] decision is erased." Hardison, 432 U.S. at 97 (Marshall, J., dissenting).
