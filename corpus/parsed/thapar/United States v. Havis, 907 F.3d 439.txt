. What we do is sometimes less important than how we do it. The United States Sentencing Commission has the power to promulgate the Sentencing Guidelines. But Congress has limited how it may exercise that power. Those limits are important—not only because Congress thinks so, but because they define the Commission's identity in our constitutional structure.
Jeffery Havis claims that the Commission has disregarded those limits. And he may have a point. But a prior published decision of our court requires that we reject this part of his argument. Following that precedent and finding Havis's other arguments unavailing, we affirm his sentence.
I.
Jeffery Havis pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). As it turns out, he had a lengthy criminal record. And at sentencing, the district court concluded that his twenty-year-old state conviction for selling or delivering cocaine amounted to a "controlled substance offense" under the Guidelines and increased his base offense level accordingly. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2016); see Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-417(a)(2)-(3) (2000).
Havis objected to the increase. He argued that delivering cocaine does not qualify as a "controlled substance offense" and that it was unclear whether his state conviction was for delivery or sale. The district court found this argument unavailing on account of this court's decision in United States v. Alexander, which held that any violation of the Tennessee statute at issue is a controlled substance offense. 686 F. App'x 326, 327-28 (6th Cir. 2017) (per curiam). The district court thus reasoned that it did not matter whether Havis was convicted of selling or delivering cocaine since both qualified as a basis to increase his sentence. Havis now appeals, and we review the district court's decision de novo. United States v. Evans, 699 F.3d 858, 862 (6th Cir. 2012).
  II.
To determine whether delivering drugs in violation of Tennessee law is a controlled substance offense, we apply the categorical approach. United States v. Woodruff, 735 F.3d 445, 449 (6th Cir. 2013). Under this approach, we care not about the facts of Havis's actual misconduct but about the elements of drug delivery under Tennessee law. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990); Woodruff, 735 F.3d at 449. Thus, our job is to match up the elements of Tennessee drug delivery with those of a "controlled substance offense" under the Guidelines and see if Tennessee criminalizes a broader range of conduct. See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599-600; Woodruff, 735 F.3d at 449. If so, no match, and the district court erred by increasing Havis's base offense  level. But if Tennessee drug delivery criminalizes the same (or a narrower) range of conduct, we have a match and the district court was right.
A.
Havis first argues that Tennessee drug delivery does not match up with a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines because the former includes attempting to transfer drugs, while the Guidelines only include completed controlled substance offenses. The problem for Havis, however, is that this court has already interpreted the Guidelines's definition of "controlled substance offense" to include attempts. Evans, 699 F.3d at 866-67. To get there, the court relied on the Guidelines's commentary, which explicitly states that a controlled substance offense "include[s] 'the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.'" Id. at 866 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1). And reliance on the commentary was necessary to the result in Evans. Id. at 868; cf. United States v. McMurray, 653 F.3d 367, 375 (6th Cir. 2011) (deeming a statement dictum where it "was not necessary to the outcome" of a prior case (quoting United States v. Turner, 602 F.3d 778, 786 (6th Cir. 2010))).
Havis argues that the Evans court erred when it relied on the commentary because the Guidelines's actual text says nothing about attempt, see U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(b), and the Sentencing Commission cannot add to the text in commentary. But save an en banc decision of this court or an intervening decision of the Supreme Court, we must follow Evans nonetheless. Salmi v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1985); see also McMurray, 653 F.3d at 375; Grundy Mining Co. v. Flynn, 353 F.3d 467, 479 (6th Cir. 2003) ("We are not free to pick and choose the portions of a prior published decision that we will follow and those that we will disregard. Nor do we enjoy greater latitude in situations where our precedents purportedly are tainted by analytical flaws[.]"). There is no way to grant Havis relief without overruling Evans's reliance on the very same commentary at issue here.
The fact that we are foreclosed from reversing a prior panel does not mean, however, that Havis's challenge to the commentary does not have legs. To understand his challenge to the Sentencing Commission's use of commentary, one must take a closer look at the Commission itself. Back in 1984, Congress created the Commission, a sort of hybrid body that does not fit squarely within any of the three branches of government. See 28 U.S.C. § 991. The agency is formally "located" within the judicial branch, but its job is to make policy judgments about criminality by promulgating the Guidelines. See id. In Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989), the Supreme Court undertook the delicate task of explaining why the Commission does not, despite its unique character, exercise both judicial and legislative functions in violation of the separation of powers. See generally id. at 380-412. The Court's explanation hinged in part on the limits Congress placed on the Commission's power to promulgate the Guidelines. First, Congress must have a chance to review amendments to the Guidelines's text before they take effect. 28 U.S.C. § 994(a), (p); Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 393-94. And second, the Sentencing Commission must comply with the notice-and-comment requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act. 28 U.S.C. § 994(x); Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 394. Without these limits, the Court explained that the Commission might be said to possess "the  power of judging joined with the legislative," Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 394 (quoting The Federalist No. 47, at 326 (James Madison) (J. Cooke ed., 1961)), thereby compromising the ability of the branches to check one another's power—"the greatest security against tyranny," id. at 381 (citing The Federalist No. 51, at 349 (James Madison) (J. Cooke ed., 1961)). But with these limits in place, the Court ruled that the Commission, although something of an odd duck, was constitutional.
A problem thus arises when the Commission bypasses these procedures by adding offenses to the Guidelines through commentary rather than through an amendment. Unlike the  text of the Guidelines, the Commission does not have to give Congress a chance to review commentary it publishes along with the Guidelines's text, nor must the Commission float commentary through notice and comment. See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 40-41, 113 S. Ct. 1913, 123 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1993); United States v. Rollins, 836 F.3d 737, 742-43 (7th Cir. 2016) (en banc). As such, the Commission may only use commentary to interpret the text that is already there. Stinson, 508 U.S. at 42-43, 47. And a comment that increases the range of conduct that the Guidelines cover has clearly taken things a step beyond interpretation. See United States v. Winstead, 890 F.3d 1082, 1090-91 (D.C. Cir. 2018); Rollins, 836 F.3d at 742.1  Indeed, when Congress wants to criminalize the attempt to commit a certain crime that is already defined in the code, it does so explicitly in the code itself. E.g., 21 U.S.C. § 846. Thus, in Havis's view, the Commission should have taken the same approach here and amended the Guidelines.
As Mistretta taught, these procedural requirements are one piece of a larger puzzle. If the Commission can add to or amend the Guidelines solely through commentary, then it possesses a great deal more legislative power than Mistretta envisioned. This means that in order to keep the Sentencing Commission in its proper constitutional position—whatever that is exactly—courts must keep Guidelines text and Guidelines commentary, which are two different vehicles, in their respective lanes. See, e.g., Winstead, 890 F.3d at 1092; Rollins, 836 F.3d at 742; United States v. Soto-Rivera, 811 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir. 2016).
Moreover, the now-advisory nature of the Guidelines does not render the limits on the Commission's rulemaking power any less important. See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005) (rendering the Guidelines "effectively advisory"). Even in light of Booker, the Commission must continue to obey its authorizing statute. 28 U.S.C. § 994(p), (x). And allowing the Commission to add to the Guidelines through commentary still poses a separation-of-powers problem. See Beckles v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 886, 895-96, 197 L. Ed. 2d 145 (2017) (emphasizing that the advisory Guidelines are not "immune from constitutional scrutiny").
  Though advisory, the Guidelines and their commentary remain the "lodestone" of federal sentencing. Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 530, 541-44, 133 S. Ct. 2072, 186 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2013). A district court must calculate a defendant's Guidelines range correctly, and in doing so, account for all applicable commentary. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007); Stinson, 508 U.S. at 42-43, 47. The court must then consider the Guidelines range in formulating a sentence and ensure that any deviation from the range "is sufficiently compelling." 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4); Gall, 552 U.S. at 50. On appeal, reviewing courts are at liberty to afford a within-Guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness, which this circuit does. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51; United States v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 389 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc). And appellate courts can reverse a sentence outside the Guidelines only if they conclude that any deviation was unreasonable. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. So just as a runner's starting position influences the time in which he finishes the race, a defendant's sentence depends in part on what the Guidelines range is, even if that range is nonbinding. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 542. As a result, the Commission's Guidelines continue to have a marked effect on sentencing, and the Commission needs to present changes to Congress and send them through notice and comment before courts apply them. Havis's argument may thus warrant revisiting Evans. Winstead, 890 F.3d at 1090-92 (holding that the Commission was without power to add attempts of controlled substance offenses to § 4B1.2(b) by way of commentary).
B.
Havis also argues that Tennessee drug delivery is overbroad because it permits a conviction for a specific type of conduct: offering to sell drugs. Evans disposes of this argument, too. There, the court held that a conviction for "an offer to sell is properly considered an attempt to transfer a controlled substance, which is a 'controlled substance offense' under the Guidelines." Evans, 699 F.3d at 867 (citing U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1). Havis acknowledges Evans, but his only effort to distinguish it is to point again to his arguments in this appeal that the definition of "controlled substance offense" should not include attempts. Maybe, but as explained above, Evans held that the definition of "controlled substance offense" does include attempts, and that decision binds us no matter the new arguments that Havis raises in this case. Grundy Mining Co., 353 F.3d at 479. So Havis's challenge on this front must also fail.
  C.
Havis next argues that even if an attempt could be a controlled substance offense, the Tennessee definition of attempt does not match up with the federal one. Both definitions require that a defendant take a "substantial step" toward the commission of an offense. Evans, 699 F.3d at 867; State v. Reeves, 916 S.W.2d 909, 912 (Tenn. 1996) (quoting Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-12-101(a)(3)). But according to Havis, what constitutes a "substantial step" is different under Tennessee and federal law.
Key to Havis's argument is the Tennessee Supreme Court's decision in State v. Reeves. In Reeves, the court interpreted a new statute that redefined the state's law of attempt. See 916 S.W.2d at 910-12. Under Tennessee's old approach, courts decided if an action was "mere preparation," on the one hand, or a post-preparation "overt act," on the other. Id. at 911. Courts took a "narrow" view toward  the latter category, resulting in very few actions amounting to an "overt act." Id. By statute, however, Tennessee broadened attempt liability through the adoption of the "substantial step" test. Id. at 911-13; see Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-12-101(a)(3). Under this new test, conduct amounts to a substantial step, and therefore an attempt, where the conduct is "strongly corroborative of the actor's overall criminal purpose." Reeves, 916 S.W.2d at 914 (emphasis added).
Based on Reeves, Havis argues that Tennessee's substantial-step test captures more conduct than that required under federal law for two reasons. First, he suggests that a "merely preparatory" action can constitute an attempt under Tennessee law but not under federal law. But this argument misreads Reeves. Havis is right that Tennessee's substantial-step test captures conduct that might not have been an "overt act" under the state's old approach. See id. at 913-14. But this does not mean that Tennessee now criminalizes conduct that is merely preparatory; rather, preparatory conduct must amount to a substantial step, which must be "strongly corroborative of the actor's overall criminal purpose." Id.; see Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-12-101 cmt. of the Tenn. Sentencing Comm'n ("[T]he point of attempt responsibility, beyond mere preparation but short of the completed offense, is reached when an individual's intentional acts constitute a 'substantial step . . . .'" (emphasis added)); accord United States v. Bell, 575 F. App'x 598, 605 (6th Cir. 2014), cert. granted, judgment vacated on other grounds, 135 S. Ct. 2934, 192 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2015) (mem.). And so while preparatory conduct can amount to an attempt in Tennessee, that conduct must still be a substantial step, just as under federal law.
Next, Havis takes issue with the line at which conduct becomes a substantial step under Tennessee and federal law. Tennessee requires conduct that is "strongly corroborative" of a defendant's criminal purpose. Reeves, 916 S.W.2d at 914 (emphasis added). But Havis reads federal law to require conduct that "unequivocally corroborate[s]" a defendant's criminal purpose. See United States v. Pennyman, 889 F.2d 104, 106 (6th Cir. 1989) (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Pennell, 737 F.2d 521, 525 (6th Cir. 1984)). Thus, because conduct might be strongly corroborative, but not unequivocally so, Havis concludes that Tennessee attempt criminalizes more conduct than federal law does.
Even if Havis's characterization of federal law is correct,2  it is not enough to  show a mismatch. Under the categorical approach, there must be a "realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility," that a state statute is overbroad. Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 191, 133 S. Ct. 1678, 185 L. Ed. 2d 727 (2013) (quoting Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 193, 127 S. Ct. 815, 166 L. Ed. 2d 683 (2007)). So when a defendant believes he has found a mismatch, he must point to a case—whether his own or another—to show a realistic probability that he is right. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 193; see, e.g., United States v. Smith, 881 F.3d 954, 958-59 (6th Cir. 2018); United States v. Harris, 853 F.3d 318, 322 (6th Cir. 2017).
 In the abstract, one could imagine a scenario in which a defendant's conduct strongly, but not unequivocally, demonstrates a criminal purpose. But Havis leaves us to our imaginations. He has identified no case—his own or any other in Tennessee—in which Tennessee has imposed attempt liability where federal law would not.3  And he needed to. At least three other courts of appeals have rejected similar challenges on the same basis. United States v. Alexander, 809 F.3d 1029, 1033 (8th Cir. 2016) (rejecting categorical challenge to Missouri's attempt statute based on lack of case law construing attempt overinclusively), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1608, 197 L. Ed. 2d 703 (2017); United States v. Garcia-Figueroa, 753 F.3d 179, 186-90 (5th Cir. 2014) (same, for Florida attempt); United States v. Saavedra-Velazquez, 578 F.3d 1103, 1107-10 (9th Cir. 2009) (same, for California attempt). We see no reason to decide this case differently. If the text of Tennessee's attempt statute was plainly overbroad, that would be a different matter. United States v. Lara, 590 F. App'x 574, 584 (6th Cir. 2014) (declining to require state-court cases where the "plain meaning of the statute" demonstrated overbreadth); see also Swaby v. Yates, 847 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2017); United States v. Titties, 852 F.3d 1257, 1274-75 (10th Cir. 2017); Ramos v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 709 F.3d 1066, 1071-72 (11th Cir. 2013); United States v. Grisel, 488 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir. 2007).
But Tennessee's statute requires a "substantial step," and Havis's argument relies on a hypothetical application of two interpretations of the term that he believes are variant. Without more, Havis's argument comes up short.
D.
On to Havis's final argument. As Havis points out, "dispensing" a drug is a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(b). And under federal law, one can "dispense" a drug by "administering" it, but only in certain circumstances. 21 U.S.C. § 802(10). Now recall that Havis's state conviction was for  delivering a controlled substance. Tenn. Code  Ann. § 39-17-417(a)(2). Havis argues that under Tennessee law, delivery encompasses any act of administering a drug, such that someone could be convicted of delivering a drug by administering it in Tennessee in a manner that would not constitute "dispensing" under the Guidelines.
Havis articulates a plausible theory that the Tennessee statute covers a broader range of conduct than the Guidelines. But again, he does not show that it could realistically occur. First, the plain text of Tennessee's statute does not command Havis's interpretation. Cf. Lara, 590 F. App'x at 584. Havis would have us infer that delivery under Tennessee law includes any type of administering a drug. He suggests that we draw this inference from Tennessee's definition of "distribute," which is "to deliver other than by administering or dispensing a controlled substance." Tenn. Code. Ann. § 39-17-402(9) (emphasis added). So, Havis reasons, if one can deliver drugs other than by administering them (at least in the context of distributing), delivery must be the broader genus of administering's species. But Havis does not find much support for this argument in Tennessee's separate definitions of "deliver" and "administer." If every act of administering was a delivery, one would expect some sort of reference to administering in Tennessee's definition of "deliver" or some reference to delivery in Tennessee's separate definition of "administer." There is none. Id. § 39-17-402(1), (6). And even if delivery includes some administering, Havis also fails to explain why we would not read Tennessee's definition of "deliver" to include administering drugs only to the extent specified in Tennessee's definition of "dispense" (which happens to match that under federal law). Id. § 39-17-402(6)-(7); 21 U.S.C. § 802(10); see United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., 684 F.2d 1174, 1186 (6th Cir. 1982) ("Different portions of the same statute should be read and interpreted consistently with each other, avoiding conflicts.").
Second, Havis cites no cases showing that Tennessee actually charges delivery based on administering a drug in a manner that would not constitute dispensing it. Smith, 881 F.3d at 958-59; see Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 193. And here again, several other circuits have rejected similar challenges on the same grounds. United States v. Burgos-Ortega, 777 F.3d 1047, 1052-55 (9th Cir. 2015) (rejecting a near-identical challenge in which the defendant failed to identify a case in which the state prosecuted someone for administering a drug); United States v. Teran-Salas, 767 F.3d 453, 458-62 (5th Cir. 2014) (same); see also United States v. Maldonado, 864 F.3d 893, 899-900 (8th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 702, 199 L. Ed. 2d 576 (2018); United States v. White, 837 F.3d 1225, 1230 (11th Cir. 2016). Thus, Havis's final argument is unavailing.
* * *
Since we are bound to reject those of Havis's arguments that our decision in United States v. Evans forecloses, and his other arguments are unpersuasive, we conclude that delivering drugs in violation of Tennessee law is a controlled substance offense under § 4B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court's decision is therefore AFFIRMED.
