 This appeal involves not one coding question, but two. The first is whether Relizorb should be bundled with other items covered by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code B4035—a code issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1320d-2, for enteral-feeding supplies. Flath and Alcresta contend that Relizorb should have its own, separate HCPCS code, and HHS now agrees. On November 5, 2018, it issued HCPCS code B4105 for any "[i]n line cartridge containing digestive enzyme(s) for enteral feeding," thus unbundling Relizorb from the various items that are grouped together under code B4035. Citation of Supplemental Authorities for Appellee, Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. v. Azar, No. 18-5192 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 6, 2018); CMS, 2019 Healthcare Common Procedures Coding System Annual Update, https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/Alpha-Numeric-HCPCS-Items/2019-Alpha-Numeric-HCPCS-File.html (last visited Nov. 28, 2018). This decision will become effective on January 1, 2019; it carries forward HHS's prior decision to issue a temporary HCPCS code for Relizorb effective July 1, 2018; and it will control HHS's still-pending reconsideration of the question whether to issue a separate HCPCS code for Relizorb for the rest of 2018. Accordingly, the dispute regarding the appropriate HCPCS billing code for Relizorb is now moot.
The second coding question arose only after HHS decided to establish a temporary HCPCS code for Relizorb. HHS appended to that code two separate indicator codes—a coverage indicator ("D") and a pricing indicator ("00"), which together informed Medicare Administrative Contractors that, for Medicare reimbursement purposes, Relizorb may not be reimbursed separately from the enteral-feeding supply kit. See Technical Direction Letter from CMS to All Medicare Administrative Contractors (July 20, 2018); CMS, Medicare Claims Processing Manual Ch. 20 § 30.7.2, https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS018912.html (last visited Nov. 28, 2018); CMS, 2018 HCPCS Record Layout § 9, https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/Alpha-Numeric-HCPCS-Items/2018-HCPCS-Record-Layout-.html  (last visited Nov. 28, 2018). HHS later appended the same indicators to the HCPCS code established for Relizorb for 2019. Flath and Alcresta now challenge HHS's decision to issue these two separate indicators.
I share my colleagues' uncertainty about when, how, or why HHS decided to bundle Relizorb with enteral-feeding supplies for Medicare reimbursement purposes, whether in the decision to attach the indicators to code B4105 (as the record seems to suggest) or in prior Medicare decisions that the indicators merely confirm (as HHS contends). Either way, the indicators do nothing more than provide guidance regarding coverage and reimbursement decisions under Medicare. Their lawfulness turns on questions of Medicare law, not HIPAA law. Accordingly, challenges to those decisions arise under the Medicare Act, and the only way to obtain judicial review of them is through 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g), 405(h), and 1395ii, which together require a beneficiary first to present a specific claim for payment to HHS and then to administratively appeal any denial. See, e.g., Am. Hosp. Ass'n v. Azar, 895 F.3d 822, 825-26 (D.C. Cir. 2018).
There is an exception when these requirements would frustrate rather than merely delay judicial review, but it does not apply here. Nothing prevents Flath from presenting to HHS a claim for payment for Relizorb. See 42 C.F.R. § 405.904(a)(2). Moreover, HHS repeatedly has represented to us that it will process such claims and ensuing appeals, thereby generating judicially reviewable orders at the end of the administrative process. On this record, we have no reason to question those representations. To be sure, Alcresta, as a manufacturer of medical equipment, cannot itself present or exhaust payment claims within the Medicare channeling scheme. See id. § 405.906(a). But that does not justify an exception to the scheme, for Flath and other Relizorb users can present and exhaust claims, and their interests align with those of Alcresta. See Council for Urological Interests v. Sebelius, 668 F.3d 704, 712-13, 399 U.S. App. D.C. 159 (D.C. Cir. 2011).
In sum, the dispute regarding HCPCS billing codes is now moot, and the challenge regarding coverage and pricing indicators, which arises under the Medicare Act, fails for lack of presentment and exhaustion. I would dismiss the appeal on these grounds, without reaching the merits.
