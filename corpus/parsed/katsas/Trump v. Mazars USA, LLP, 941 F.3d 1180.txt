, with whom Circuit Judge HENDERSON joins, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:
If the competing opinions here demonstrate anything, it is that this case presents exceptionally important questions regarding the separation of powers among Congress, the Executive Branch, and the Judiciary. For the second time in American history, an Article III court has undertaken to enforce a congressional subpoena for the records of a sitting President. The first time that was attempted, we took the case en banc, refused to enforce the subpoena, and stressed that the availability of impeachment foreclosed any conclusion that the records at issue were "demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment" of Congress's legislative prerogatives, even when Congress was investigating significant allegations of presidential misconduct. Senate Select Comm. on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 731-33, 162 U.S. App. D.C. 183 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (en banc).
This case differs from Senate Select Committee in two respects, but neither diminishes its comparative importance. First, the subpoena at issue is directed not to the President directly, but to an accounting firm holding his personal financial records. Yet as Judge Rao has explained, that difference in form does not matter, because the subpoena in substance targets his records. Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, No. 19-5142, slip op. at 9-11 (Rao, J., dissenting). Second, Senate Select Committee involved official communications over which the President had asserted executive privilege, whereas this case involves personal records and no privilege assertion. But that difference cuts in both directions. On the one hand, this case does not implicate the President's need to secure candid advice from close governmental advisors—the interest supporting a presidential communications  privilege covering various official-capacity records. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 742-44, 326 U.S. App. D.C. 276 (D.C. Cir. 1997). On the other hand, the unavailability of that privilege creates an open season on the President's personal records. Under the panel's analysis, whenever Congress conceivably could pass legislation regarding the President, it also may compel the President to disclose personal records that might inform the legislation. And precisely because such demands would target his personal records, the President would have no privilege-based ground for making the records even "presumptively" unavailable. See id. at 744.
This threat to presidential autonomy and independence is far greater than that presented by compulsory process issued by prosecutors in criminal cases, as in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974), or even by private plaintiffs in civil cases, as in Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 117 S. Ct. 1636, 137 L. Ed. 2d 945 (1997). In those circumstances, governing rules provide for trimming any requests to avoid "embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2). Moreover, the rules are applied by judges instructed that avoiding "potential burdens on the President ... should inform the conduct of the entire proceeding." Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. at 707. By contrast, under the panel's uncompromising extension of McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 47 S. Ct. 319, 71 L. Ed. 580 (1927), and its progeny to the President, the courts are powerless to take comparable considerations into account. See Mazars USA, LLP, slip op. at 23. Thus, the scope of required disclosure is determined not by neutral judges applying some form of rule-based interest balancing, but by the whim of Congress—the President's constitutional rival for political power—or even, as in this case, by one committee of one House of Congress. With regard to the threat to the Presidency, "this wolf comes as a wolf." Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 699, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).
