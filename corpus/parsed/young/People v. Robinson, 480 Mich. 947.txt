  
Dissent




YOUNG, J., dissents and states as follows:
I respectfully dissent from this Court's order reversing the order of the Court of Appeals denying defendant's motion to file a supplemental brief and remanding this case to the Court of Appeals for plenary consideration of the issue raised in defendant's supplemental brief. A party may not file a supplemental brief in the Court of Appeals except "by leave of the Court." MCR 7.212(G). With the assistance of counsel, defendant filed his initial brief on September 5, 2006. Upon defendant's request, his counsel filed in the trial court a motion to withdraw, which was granted on February 15, 2007. Substitute counsel was appointed on April 19, 2007. On July 9, 2007, the day before this case was submitted on the case call, substitute counsel moved to file a supplemental brief. On July 17, 2007, the Court of Appeals denied defendant's motion and returned the supplemental brief. I disagree with the majority that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by denying defendant's 11th hour motion to add issues to his appeal.  Therefore, I would deny his application and require him to raise these issues in a motion for relief from judgment.
