 Young, C.J. (concurring).
Although the majority opinion correctly recognizes that Potter v McLeary controls whether a medical malpractice claimant must serve a notice of intent (NOI) on a professional corporation (PC) before initiating a lawsuit,79  I continue to adhere to my partial dissent in Potter.80  Nevertheless, I join the majority opinion because it faithfully applies the rule established in Potter and because the jurisprudence of this state benefits from having a clear majority rule of law in this case.81
