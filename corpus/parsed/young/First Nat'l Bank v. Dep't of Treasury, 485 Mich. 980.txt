I concur in the order reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanding the case to the Court of Claims for consideration of plaintiff's remaining issues. I would further note that the constructive notice provided by recording a certificate of forfeiture pursuant to MCL 211.78g(2) provides constitutionally adequate notice for those property interests that are unknown and not of record at the time the property is forfeited to the county treasurer. See Mullane v Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co, 339 U.S. 306, 317; 70 S. Ct. 652; 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950); Mennonite Bd of Missions v Adams, 462 U.S. 791, 798; 103 S. Ct. 2706; 77 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1983). Moreover, this particular method of notice "is not substantially less likely to bring home notice than other of the feasible and customary substitutes," Mullane, 339 U.S. at 315, and is given in addition to other methods of constructive notice required by law. MCL 211.78i(3)(d) and (5). Because plaintiff has received constitutionally adequate notice, I believe that any further inquiry into the quality of notice given to plaintiff's assignor is wholly unnecessary.
