Concur




Young, Jr., J., concurs and states as follows:
Because defendant seeks an even greater downward departure than he agreed to in his plea bargain, I concur with the denial of defendant's application for leave to appeal. However, I write separately to question the propriety of the trial court's sentencing decision. The trial court accepted the plea-bargained sentence recommendation, which amounted to a downward departure from the statutory minimum sentence, without finding substantial and compelling reasons for the downward departure. I believe that MCL 769.34(3) may have implications for our traditional plea bargaining process. However, as no party has raised this question, a denial of this application is appropriate.
