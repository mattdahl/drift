In the recent history of this Court, we have attempted to instill constancy and clarity in our criminal jurisprudence by declining to engage in posthoc and inconsistent error correction and by requiring issue preservation as a prerequisite to obtaining relief. See, e.g.,  People v Carines, 460 Mich. 750, 764-765, 597 N.W.2d 130 (1999) (citation omitted) ("Requiring a  contemporaneous objection provides the trial court 'an opportunity to correct the error, which could thereby obviate the necessity of further legal proceedings and would be by far the best time to address a defendant's constitutional and nonconstitutional rights.'") 
In this case, we are granting relief on an issue that was unpreserved in both the trial court and the Court of Appeals. Granting relief in this manner serves as a disincentive to the observation of our more recent practice of requiring issue preservation. The majority's decision today undermines the finality of judgments.
