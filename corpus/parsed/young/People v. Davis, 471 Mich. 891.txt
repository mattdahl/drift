 YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the majority's decision to vacate the Court of Appeals order and remand this case to the Ingham Circuit Court for resentencing under People v Babcock, 469 Mich. 247; 666 N.W.2d 231 (2003). The trial court did not articulate a basis for departure that satisfies the standards set forth in Babcock. But as is the case in People v Davis, 471 Mich. 891; 687 N.W.2d 597; 2004 Mich. LEXIS 1908 Docket No. 125925, the record in this matter includes substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the sentencing guidelines upon remand. In particular, departure may be justified because the sentencing guidelines  give insufficient weight to the fact that defendant sexually assaulted his eleven-year-old cousin on multiple occasions.
