 Young, C.J. (concurring).
I concur in the majority's decision to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant's conviction and sentence. Even if parole officer Cheryl Evans's interrogation of defendant was a custodial interrogation by a law enforcement officer, the facts here indicate that defendant waived any right to have counsel present during this interrogation.1  As a result, I believe that the question whether defendant's interrogation was custodial for Miranda purposes is immaterial to the result in this case.
Evans testified at trial that defendant had submitted a letter to police indicating that he wanted to talk with them again and that defendant had reiterated that request when talking with her.2  Because defendant had already sought to discuss the case with the police at the time Evans questioned him about the robbery, he "initiate[d] further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police."3  Furthermore, this initiation of communication with Evans (even assuming for the purposes of Miranda that she was a law enforcement  officer) was knowing and intelligent.4  Initially, "defendant was properly advised of his rights and understood them . . . ."5  And his request at the end of the meeting that Evans reiterate to the police his desire to speak with them underscores that his waiver was knowing and intelligent. Moreover, as the majority rightly notes, this request "'strongly suggests that he was not misled by any expectation that his statements [to her] would remain confidential.'"6  Therefore, as Evans did not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, I concur that his conviction should be affirmed.
