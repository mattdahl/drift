I concur in the result and analysis of the majority opinion. I write separately because I will not join footnote 14, in which Justice Cavanagh "dissents" from the Carines 1  plain-error analysis in his own opinion. Justice Cavanagh is entitled to such views, but his opposition to this Court's precedent and preservation of his view is better placed in a concurring statement.
