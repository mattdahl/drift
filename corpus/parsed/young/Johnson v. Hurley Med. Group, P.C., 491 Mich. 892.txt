 Young, C.J. (concurring).
I fully concur in the Court's order. I conclude that even if Bush v Shabahang, 484 Mich 156; 772 N.W.2d 272 (2009), applied in this case, the decision of the panel of the Court of Appeals should be reversed because a statute of limitations defense is a substantial right of a party. DeCosta v Gossage, 486 Mich 116, 138; 782 N.W.2d 734 (2010) (Markman, J., dissenting), citing Gladych v New Family Homes, Inc, 468 Mich 594, 600; 664 N.W.2d 705 (2003).
Cavanagh, Marilyn Kelly, and Hathaway, JJ., would deny leave to appeal.
