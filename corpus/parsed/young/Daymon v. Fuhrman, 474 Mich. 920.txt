I fully concur in Justice CORRIGAN'S dissenting statement. While this Court has long recognized that the corporate form may be disregarded in certain circumstances, see, e.g., Fors v Farrell 271 Mich. 358; 260 N.W. 886 (1935), this Court has never adopted a clear test to determine when piercing the corporate veil is appropriate. Because the issue is jurisprudentially significant, and deserves the full attention of this Court, I would grant leave to appeal.
