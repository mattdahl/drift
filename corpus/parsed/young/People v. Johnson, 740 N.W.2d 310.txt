 YOUNG, J., dissents and states as follows:
This Court has made an extraordinary request that the prosecutor explain why the Department of Corrections has continued to imprison defendant, who was convicted of assault with intent to commit armed robbery. Setting aside the obvious procedural barriers to defendant's application, this Court has no jurisdiction over the Department of Correction's decisions denying parole, and there is no relief this Court can grant if the prosecutor's answer proves to be unsatisfactory to those members of the Court who are requiring this action. Therefore, this order is, in my view, simply an empty gesture.
Defendant has been before this Court a number of times. When defendant first appealed, the Court of Appeals issued a published opinion affirming his conviction. 130 Mich App 26; 343 N.W.2d 226 (1983). This Court remanded the case to the Genesee Circuit Court to articulate the reasons for imposing a life sentence. 419 Mich 920; 354 N.W.2d 262 (1984). After remand, this Court denied defendant's application for leave to appeal over Justice Ryan's dissent. 422 Mich 897; 367 N.W.2d 331 (1985). Since then, defendant has filed a number of motions for relief from judgment, but did not seek leave to appeal in this Court when the first two were denied. When he sought leave to appeal in this Court the third motion for relief from judgment, his appeal was denied as a successive motion failing to meet the requirements of MCR 6.502(G). 472 Mich 921; 696 N.W.2d 716 (2005). This Court denied defendant's motion for reconsideration, and Justice Cavanagh dissented and stated that he would "grant leave to explore what relief could be afforded this defendant." 474 Mich 924; 706 N.W.2d 7 (2005) (Cavanagh, J. dissenting). The current application is from defendant's fourth motion for relief from judgment.
Defendant's main quarrel is that he and the trial judge believed that, even though defendant was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole, he would probably be out of prison in 10 years. That argument is defeated by People v Moore, 468 Mich 573, 580; 664 N.W.2d 700 (2003), in which this Court held that "the failure to accurately predict the actions of the Parole Board does not constitute a misapprehension of the law that could render the sentence invalid." The affidavit and letter from Judge Borradaile, the sentencing judge, that defendant submitted reflect a misapprehension on par with that of the trial judge in Moore.
Because defendant's sentence is proper, he is ultimately attempting to appeal the Department of Correction's decision to deny him parole. Under MCL 791.235(1), "[t]he release of a prisoner on parole shall be granted solely upon the initiative of the parole board." The statute entitles defendant to "a written explanation of the reason for denial and, if appropriate, specific recommendations for corrective action the prisoner may take to facilitate release." MCL 791.235(12). However, defendant is not entitled to appeal the decision of the Parole Board. MCL 791.234(11). 1  Defendant has not even alleged any violations of the procedures of the parole act. 
Given that defendant's sentence is valid and it is not contested that the Parole Board has complied with the statute, I am uncertain what end is served by requiring the prosecutor to respond to this meritless  application. There is simply no authority for this Court to order defendant's release. Consequently, however upset members of the Court may be about the time that this defendant has served for assault with intent to commit armed robbery, there is essentially nothing this Court can do to impose its will on the Parole Board.
