YOUNG, J. (concurring).
Although I recognize this Court's decision in People v Katt, 468 Mich 272; 662 N.W.2d 12 (2003), controls the application of Michigan Rule of Evidence 803(24), I continue to adhere to the positions stated in my dissenting opinion in Katt.
KELLY, C.J., would grant leave to appeal.
