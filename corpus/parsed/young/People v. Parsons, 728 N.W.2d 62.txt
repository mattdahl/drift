I concur in the order, but write solely to illustrate for the public the inconsistency of Justice Weaver's newfound desire for openness on this Court.
Until recently, Justice Weaver was fully content to follow the traditions of this Court. In fact, as Justice Weaver concedes, she has declined to participate in more than 250 cases and refused to publicly disclose her reasons for doing so. See Advocacy Org for Patients & Providers v Auto Club Ins Ass'n, 472 Mich. 91, 97; 693 N.W.2d 358 n 1 (2005) (Weaver, J., concurring). Yet, contrary to the tradition of this Court and her personal practices, Justice Weaver now contends that a justice must explain why he or she chooses to recuse in a particular case. Her ostensible justification for her new position is Const 1963, art 6, ยง 6, which requires that "[d]ecisions of the supreme court . . . be in writing and . . . contain a concise statement of the facts and reasons for each decision . . . ." Our disqualification practice requires that each justice assess whether it is appropriate to sit in a particular case. Thus, the decision whether to sit is one made only by that justice and is not a "decision of the supreme court" within the meaning of Const 1963, art 6, ยง 6. It should be stressed that until recently, Justice Weaver never believed that this constitutional provision applied to recusal decisions. Justice Weaver's own longstanding practice (in which she declined to state her reasons for self-disqualification) was not only consistent with the Court's historic disqualification practice but with the constitution as well.
Most significant about Justice Weaver's novel reliance on this constitutional provision is her selective application of this provision to her colleagues. Her newfound "constitutional mandate" apparently does not bind Justices Kelly and Cavanagh. In Reed v Breton, 475 Mich. 531; 718 N.W.2d 770 (2006), Kakish v Dominion of Canada Gen Ins Co, 476 Mich. 854; 718 N.W.2d 357 (2006), and Smith v Smith, 474 Mich. 1091; 711 N.W.2d 352 (2006)--all recent cases in which Justice Cavanagh disqualified himself from participation without disclosing his reasons--Justice Weaver made no complaint that he violated the constitution for failing to do so. Similarly, when Justice Kelly declined to participate in Sahr v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, 477 Mich. 858; 721 N.W.2d 172 (2006), Beckes v Detroit Diesel Corp, 475 Mich. 878; 715 N.W.2d 774 (2006), and People v Mox, 475 Mich. 867; 714 N.W.2d 302 (2006), without stating her reasons, again Justice Weaver made no demand for disclosure on Justice Kelly, nor did she claim that Justice Kelly's silence implicated "the impartiality of the judiciary." Certainly, if the failure to disclose the reasons for recusal casts "a cloak of secrecy" around the Court, as Justice Weaver now claims, then her demands ought to be applied uniformly.
Only in response to this statement has Justice Weaver ever challenged a recusal decision of Justice Cavanagh or Justice Kelly. She cites the pending case of White v Hahn, 2007 Mich. LEXIS 496, Docket No. 132191, in support of her evenhanded application of her novel constitutional mandate. However, even her explanation of her position in Hahn belies her claim of uniformity. Justice Weaver pronounces that Justice Cavanagh's recusal meets her standard of "public disclosure" because Justice Cavanagh privately disclosed to members of the Court his reasons  for refusing to participate in the case. One will search the public record of this Court in vain for a public explanation why Justice Cavanagh and Justice Kelly have chosen to disqualify themselves in any other particular cases. But more important to this discussion, one will also search in vain to find a statement from Justice Weaver commenting on their failure to state publicly their reasons for recusal.
Because Justice Cavanagh and Justice Kelly have been following the traditions of this Court in recusal matters, there is no reason to criticize them. However, Justice Weaver ought to explain why she fails to apply her rules to all justices of this Court. Justice Weaver makes no real effort to explain the inconsistency of the demands she places upon Chief Justice Taylor, Justices Corrigan and Markman, and me and those she places (or refuses to place) on Justices Cavanagh and Kelly. 8 
It is well past time for Justice Weaver to end her siege and begin to again devote her energies to the work of this Court rather than the destruction of her colleagues and the reputation of this Court.
CORRIGAN, J., not participating, states as follows:
The current act in the theater of the Michigan Supreme Court puts me in mind of Zero Mostel's rendition of the song "Comedy Tonight" 9 :  
Something familiar,
Something peculiar,
Something for everyone:
A comedy tonight!
Something appealing,
Something appalling,
Something for everyone:
A comedy tonight!
* * *
No royal curse, no Trojan horse,
And a happy ending, of course!
Goodness and badness,
Panic is madness--
This time it all turns out all right!
Tragedy tomorrow,
Comedy tonight!
At our conference on January 31, 2007, I declared myself not participating in this case and further declined to give a statement of reasons for nonparticipation, as is the traditional practice of our Court. Justice Weaver then declared that she would issue a statement opposing my decision not to furnish reasons; her doing so will delay the disposition of this case. Accordingly, I feel compelled to disclose my reasons for nonparticipation in the interest of a speedy disposition of this apparent emergency.
My beloved son, Daniel Corrigan Grano, is a third-year law student and, at age 25, a city councilman who has, believe it or not, political aspirations. Dan also works as a law clerk at the small, excellent firm of Flood, Lanctot, & Connor, the lawyers who are defending the Parsons case. I do not know on what cases Dan performs legal research, nor am I aware that any screening is occurring in the law firm regarding his assignments. Thus, he may well have worked on this case, and we may  well have discussed this very case at the dinner table, not realizing that it would ultimately come before this Court. Thus, I am not comfortable in sitting in this case. Lest there be any doubt, however, I am totally, completely, 100 percent biased and prejudiced in favor of my son Daniel. I have been since he was just a gleam in his father's eye, and I plan to hug him no matter how old he gets! (He is also very handsome!)
I have not participated in the substantive merits of this case. I initially declined to furnish my reasons so as not to either embarrass my son or afford unearned publicity to him or his law firm. It does not take hundreds of pages or complex rules of disqualification to understand that a mother should not judge a case involving her son. 10  And restraint of speech on the subject is just sensible.
Justice Weaver has forced my hand in the interests of her own agenda. I now say to her, as she herself once liked to say, "Let's cut the comedy." 11  Betty, can't we stop wasting the taxpayers' money on this frolic and detour? Or are you determined to continue these theatrics, hoping that public opinion will somehow support your desire to abolish our elective system for justices and judges? Whatever your goal, this low comedy of your making can only end in tragedy: the public's loss of respect for this Court and for our state's judicial branch.
 All seven of us are fortunate to be sworn to deliver on the promise of ordered liberty to the people of Michigan. That is what we have been doing to the best of our abilities. I again call on Justice Weaver, my one-time friend and still colleague, to rejoin the fold of ordinary mortals with the other six of the people's justices, doing the people's important work. As I have told Justice Weaver, I am praying--as are many others of our fellow citizens--for her personally and for her to put an end to this sad and low-comic chapter in our Court's history. We should do what mere mortals do--forgive our trespasses against one another so we can execute our sworn duty and deliberate together.
