).
I concur in this Court's decision to remand this case in light of Regents of the Univ. of Mich. v. Titan Ins. Co., 487 Mich 289, 791 N.W.2d 897, 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1658 (2010). However, I write separately to note that I continue to adhere to the positions stated in Justice MARKMAN's dissenting opinion in that case, which I joined, as well as my statement dissenting from this Court's decision to deny rehearing in that case. See Univ of Mich Regents, 487 Mich at 330-348, 2010 Mich. LEXIS 1658 (2010) (MARKMAN, J., dissenting); Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co,  488 Mich 893, 896-899, 2010 Mich. LEXIS 2102 (10/15/10) (denying rehearing) (YOUNG, J., dissenting). In particular, I note that the uncorrected confusion created by the majority opinion's use of "incompetent" where the statute plainly uses "insane" may prove especially troubling in cases such as this.
