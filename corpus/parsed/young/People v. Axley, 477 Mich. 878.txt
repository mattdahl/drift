YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the order denying leave to appeal. In her application for leave to appeal, defendant argued that the extent of the sentencing court's upward departure from the sentencing guidelines was an abuse of discretion. Defendant did not raise the issue whether the United States Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531; 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004), applied to Michigan's intermediate sentencing guidelines scheme. MCL 769.34(4)(a). Generally, appeals are limited to those issues raised in the application for leave to appeal, MCR 7.302(G)(4) , and arguments not raised and preserved for review are deemed waived. People v Stanaway, 446 Mich. 643; 521 N.W.2d 557 (1994).
