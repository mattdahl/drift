 YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the order to deny leave to appeal. I write separately to address Justice KELLY'S argument that the defendant has the right to file multiple "Standard 4" pro se briefs.
A jury convicted defendant of possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine. Defendant's first appointed appellate attorney filed a brief for defendant. Defendant filed a supplemental brief in propria persona. He then asked his appellate attorney to withdraw. A second appointed appellate attorney also eventually withdrew. The Court of Appeals allowed his third appointed appellate attorney 28 days to file a supplemental brief. That attorney advised defendant that he was unsure whether defendant could file a second pro se brief, but that at the latest, such a brief must be filed within 84 days. The Court of Appeals issued its opinion before the 84 days elapsed.
Administrative Order No. 2004-6, Standard 4, allows a defendant to file a brief in propria persona, raising issues that the defendant's attorney does not believe are meritorious. Standard 4 states: "Defendant's filing shall consist of one brief filed with or without an appropriate accompanying motion." (Emphasis added.) In this case, defendant did in fact file a brief and the Court of Appeals considered it. Because the rule does not provide for multiple pro se briefs, there is no basis in the text of the rule to conclude, as Justice Kelly does, that the defendant is entitled to file more than one pro se brief.
