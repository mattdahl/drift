YOUNG, J. (concurring.)
I concur in the order denying leave to appeal. According to the record, the "lynch pin" of the trial court's decision to send the minor child to a public school was MCL 722.23(j), which considers the "willingness and ability of each of the parties to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between the child and the other parent . . . ."
The record amply supports the trial court's conclusion that the two parents simply "do not communicate," and that the mother's desire to homeschool the child would result in the father being precluded from having any "say or involvement in his child's education." While regrettable, I do not view the stray remarks of the trial court, which appear to reflect a view of homeschooling as less beneficial than a public school, as altering the legitimacy or primacy of the trial court's best interests determination.
