YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
In light of Michigan Basic's decision to delay the implementation of the first rate increase to April 1, 2010, I would deny leave to appeal in this case and not issue an emergency stay preventing the rate increase originally scheduled to occur on March 1, 2010. There clearly is no longer an emergency requiring this Court's immediate action. Instead, I would direct the Court of Appeals to issue its decision before April 1, 2010.
CORRIGAN and MARKMAN, JJ., join the statement of YOUNG, J.
