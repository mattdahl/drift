  
Concur




 YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I disagree with the assumption of the Court of Appeals that the offense for which defendant was charged, obtaining a controlled substance by fraud, MCL 333.7407(1)(c), is one of the enumerated offenses within the scope of MCL 333.7411. Nevertheless, because the prosecutor never challenged the applicability of § 7411 to defendant's offense and the Court of Appeals never addressed this point, I am disinclined to address the issue. 
CORRIGAN, C.J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
