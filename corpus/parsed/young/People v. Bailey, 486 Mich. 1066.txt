I dissent from the majority order peremptorily reversing defendant's conviction for the second conspiracy charge. In focusing  narrowly on the "factors set forth in People v Mezy," the majority fails to give meaning to the most important language of the Mezy double jeopardy analysis: that we must look to the "totality of the circumstances," including the nonexclusive list of factors outlined in Mezy, to determine whether a defendant has committed one or multiple conspiracies. 4  Moreover, because of this flawed analysis, the majority order fails to consider whether the trial court clearly erred in determining, based on the totality of the circumstances, that defendant had committed two separate conspiracies. 5  
Here, the trial court considered the totality of the circumstances surrounding the two charged incidents of delivering a controlled substance and the attendant conspiracy charges. In doing so, the trial court considered various uncharged controlled buys as well as the charged incidents. After considering the entire body of evidence, the court found that defendant had directed each sale individually. Therefore, the court concluded that defendant had engaged in a series of conspiracies rather than one overarching conspiracy to deliver controlled substances. The trial court correctly considered the totality of the circumstances (including the nonexclusive list of enumerated factors) as directed by Mezy. Further, although I may not have reached the same factual conclusions as the trial court, I do not believe that the trial court committed clear error. Accordingly, I would deny leave to appeal.
