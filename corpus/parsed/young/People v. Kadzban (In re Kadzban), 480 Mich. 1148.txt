Because this motion is a successive motion for relief from judgment, it is governed by MCR 6.502(G). That rule bars successive motions for relief from judgment unless the motion qualifies under MCR 6.502(G)(2). Under that subsection, "[a] defendant may file a second or subsequent motion based on a retroactive change in law that occurred after the first motion for relief from judgment or a claim of new evidence that was not discovered before the first such motion." MCR 6.502(G)(2). The majority has remanded for an evidentiary hearing under People v Ginther, 390 Mich 436; 212 N.W.2d 922 (1976), to determine whether respondent's appellate counsel was ineffective. I am uncertain how that hearing will lead to information that will allow respondent to pursue a successive motion for relief from judgment. Assuming that the court finds that respondent's appellate counsel was ineffective, which Justice Corrigan correctly notes is highly unlikely, there is no reason why such ineffectiveness could not have been discovered before respondent's first motion for relief from judgment. Therefore, the rule bars a successive motion for relief from judgment based on the alleged ineffectiveness of appellate counsel. Because respondent's successive motion for relief from judgment is barred by MCR 6.502, I would deny his application for leave to appeal.
