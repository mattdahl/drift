Young, C.J. (concurring).
I concur in the decision to direct the prosecutor to respond to the application for leave to appeal and would further ask the prosecutor to address whether there is a temporal limit on the circuit court's ability to correct an invalid judgment of sentence. See MCR 6.429(A).
