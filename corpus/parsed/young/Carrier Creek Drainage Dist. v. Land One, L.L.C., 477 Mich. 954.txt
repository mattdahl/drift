  
Concur




Young, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the Court's decision to deny leave to appeal in this case. I believe the Court of Appeals interpretation of MCL 213.55(3) may be erroneous, but the Legislature recently amended the statute to cure any error that arose from the Court of Appeals opinion, 2006 PA 439, limiting the jurisprudential significance of this case. Moreover, defendant's offer of proof regarding the possibility of rezoning appears to have been insufficient to merit relief. Because of the limited jurisprudential significance and arguable deficiency in the proofs, there is no longer a need for this Court to intervene.
Markman, J., joins the statement of Young, J.
