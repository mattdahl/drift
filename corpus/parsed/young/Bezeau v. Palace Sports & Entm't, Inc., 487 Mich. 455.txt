I dissent from the decision by the majority of justices to "overrule the retroactive effect of Karaczewski." 1  Having failed to identify any flaw in the analysis of Karaczewski, overruling the application of the case is simply a means of substantively  overruling Karaczewski without explicitly saying so. Karaczewski properly interpreted the plain language of MCL 418.845, and it was appropriately applied to the case at bar by the lower courts. Because the majority justices essentially render Karaczewski an advisory opinion, I dissent.
At the time of plaintiff's injury, MCL 418.845 provided:
The bureau shall have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered outside this state where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time of injury and the contract of hire was made in this state. Such employee or his dependents shall be entitled to the compensation and other benefits provided by this act. [Emphasis added.]
Here, there is no question that plaintiff was not a resident of this state when he was injured. Therefore, pursuant to MCL 418.845 and Karaczewski, the magistrate correctly held that the Workers' Compensation Agency did not have jurisdiction. 2  This Court expressly stated in Karaczewski that its decision was to be applied to all pending cases. Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 44 n 15 ("[O]ur holding in this case shall apply to all claimants for whom there has not been a final judgment awarding benefits as of the date of this opinion."). Because this was a pending case when Karaczewski was decided, Karaczewski is applicable.
  As Karaczewski noted, since the very first workers' compensation jurisdictional statute was enacted in 1921, the law consistently provided the Michigan workers' compensation system jurisdiction over out-of-state injuries when both (1) the injured employee resided in this state at the time of injury and (2) the contract of hire was made in Michigan. However, in Boyd v W G Wade Shows, 443 Mich 515; 505 NW2d 544 (1993), this Court declined to enforce the residency requirement because to do so would be "undesirable" and "unduly restrictive" 3  and because the requirement had been ignored by this Court since Roberts v I X L Glass Corp, 259 Mich 644; 244 NW 188 (1932). 4  
Karaczewski overruled Boyd on the basis of the rather unremarkable proposition that the use of the conjunction "and" in MCL 418.845 was unambiguous and that the statute must be applied as written. Nonetheless, in order to protect the reliance interests of injured plaintiffs who had already received an award of compensation benefits as part of a final judgment, Karaczewski's holding was given limited retroactive effect, applying only to claimants who had not received a final judgment awarding benefits as of the date of the opinion. 5  While the Legislature  subsequently amended the relevant statutory provision to expand the agency's jurisdiction over out-of-state injuries, 6  the Legislature chose not to give the amended statute retroactive application, 7  thus leaving claimants such as plaintiff subject to the holding in Karaczewski. 8  
The justices in the majority are unable to identify any analytical defect in the substantive holding in Karaczewski; indeed, Justice WEAVER explicitly concurred in Karaczewski's substantive analysis. Instead, they elect to overrule the limited retroactive application of the opinion in favor of purely prospective application. 9  However, as Wayne Co v Hathcock explained, purely prospective opinions are effectively advisory opinions, and our constitutional authority to issue advisory opinions is limited to those circumstances set forth in Const 1963, art 3, ยง 8, which are clearly not applicable in the present case. 10  
 The decision in this case is another instance in which the Court's new philosophical majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare decisis. 11   Since the shift in the Court's philosophical majority in January 2009, the new majority has pointedly sought out precedents only recently decided 12  and has failed to give effect to other recent precedents of this Court. 13  Today, by overruling the retroactivity of Karaczewski,  the Court again refuses to apply a recent precedent of this Court. Because the justices in the majority use prospectivity as a means of substantively overruling Karaczewski, I dissent.
