YOUNG, Jr., P.J. (concurring). I concur in the majority's opinion concerning the resolution of the constitutional claim. I write separately to indicate that I reach  by a slightly different route the conclusion that the Parole Board may legally continue the practice of permitting two of three members of a Parole Board panel to decide parole eligibility without meeting for collegial discussion.
I agree with the majority that it is appropriate to address the Parole Board's claim that the trial court erred in concluding that the Parole Board's practice of deciding parole eligibility on the basis of a "noncollegial" vote of two members of a three-member panel was violative of MCL 791.206(2); MSA 28.2776(2) and 1996 AACS, R 791.7765. Although moot in this case, the legitimacy of this practice presents a recurring question that may evade appellate review. See In re Midland Publishing Co, Inc, 420 Mich. 148, 152, n2; 362 N.W.2d 580 (1984).
However, I conclude that the Parole Board's practice is lawful solely because it is entirely consistent with the text of the relevant statute and administrative rule. Our role in considering such matters is to determine the legislative (or administrative) intent by construing the text and giving its words their reasonable meaning.  Lorencz v. Ford Motor Co, 439 Mich. 370, 376-377; 483 N.W.2d 844 (1992). Once we have done so, and if we find the text unambiguous, our task in construing a statute is at an end and we must simply apply the statute to the situation at hand.  Turner v. Augo Club Ins. Ass'n, 448 Mich. 22, 27; 528 N.W.2d 681 (1985).
Nothing in the statute or administrative rule precludes the Parole Board's stated practice. Consequently, I find it unnecessary to consider nontextual bases for reversing the trial court's contrary decision and would reverse solely on the basis that the practice  is allowed by the terms of the statute and implementing administrative rule. n1.
