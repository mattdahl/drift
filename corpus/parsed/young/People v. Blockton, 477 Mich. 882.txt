  
Concur




YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the order remanding to the circuit court to amend the judgment of sentence, and otherwise denying leave to appeal. In his application for leave to appeal, defendant argued that the trial court's decision to upwardly depart from the sentencing guidelines was not supported by substantial and compelling factors that were objective and verifiable. Defendant did not raise the issue whether the United States Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531; 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004), applied to Michigan's intermediate sentencing guidelines scheme. MCL 769.34(4)(a). Generally, appeals are limited to those issues raised in the application for leave to appeal, MCR 7.302(G)(4), and arguments not raised and preserved for review are deemed waived. People v Stanaway, 446 Mich. 643; 521 N.W.2d 557 (1994).
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
KELLY, J., would grant leave to appeal.
