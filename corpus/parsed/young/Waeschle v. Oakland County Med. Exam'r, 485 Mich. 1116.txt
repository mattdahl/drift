I would decline to answer the certified question. I continue to adhere to my stated position in In re Certified Question (Wayne Co v Philip Morris Inc), 622 NW2d 518 (Mich, 2001), that this Court lacks the authority under state law to answer certified questions. However, this position has failed to carry the day. See Proposed Amendment of MCR 7.305, 462 Mich 1208 (2000). As the final arbiter of state law, this Court has concluded that it has the authority to answer certified questions. Accordingly, while this Court may exercise that authority, I will exercise careful discretion before answering any certified question. I would decline to answer the question in this instance.
