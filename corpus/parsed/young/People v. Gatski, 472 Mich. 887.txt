Concur




YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the majority's decision to deny the application for leave to appeal because I believe that defendant was properly prosecuted under MCL 324.73102(1). However, like Chief Justice Taylor, I believe that the Court of Appeals method of construing § 73102--most notably, its invocation of the "absurd results" doctrine--was erroneous. See People v McIntire, 461 Mich. 147; 599 N.W.2d 102 (1999).
