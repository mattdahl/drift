I concur in the denial of the application for leave to appeal for two reasons. First, plaintiffs waived the argument that the Oakland Circuit Court was precluded from considering the Cromwells' motion under MCL 710.45 by failing to raise that argument in their first appeal. Second, even if plaintiffs had made this argument in a timely fashion, they would not be entitled to relief under MCL 710.45. The Clinton Circuit Court vacated the adoption order which, according to plaintiffs, would have barred the Cromwells' motion. Thus, the motion upon which plaintiffs rely no longer has legal effect and cannot support reversal under MCL 710.45(3).
