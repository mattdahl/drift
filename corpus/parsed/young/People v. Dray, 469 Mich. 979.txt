I dissent from the order granting the prosecutor's requested relief in this interlocutory matter and I would deny leave to appeal. I agree with the conclusion of dissenting Judge Griffin that the probate court order is properly admissible pursuant to MCL 600.2106. However, the prosecutor rested solely on MRE 803(23) in advocating the admission of the probate court order, and the statutory basis for its admission was apparently raised sua sponte by Judge Griffin. Because the prosecutor did not at any time raise and preserve the argument that MCL 600.2106 required admission of the proffered evidence, the trial court simply cannot be said to have abused its discretion in failing to admit the order on that basis. 
Cavanagh, J., concurs in the dissent of Young,  J.
