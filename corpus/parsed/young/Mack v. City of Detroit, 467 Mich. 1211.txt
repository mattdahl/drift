I concur with the denial of plaintiff's motion for rehearing. I write separately to address the concerns raised by Justice CAVANAGH in his dissenting statement.
In our opinion,   467 Mich. 186;  649 N.W.2d 47 (2002), plaintiff lost part of her appeal because there is no cause of action against a governmental entity for discrimination based on sexual orientation. Justice CAVANAGH's due process arguments fail to consider that if we remanded plaintiff's sexual orientation discrimination claim, no possible amendment would have been successful because the underlying right she sought to vindicate could not be secured under state law. Thus, a remand on that claim would have caused her to engage in a futile exercise. 1 
 That the plaintiff has no cause of action for sexual orientation discrimination is the fundamental fact that distinguishes this case from the case Justice CAVANAGH relies on for his due process criticism,  Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Sav Co v Hill, 281 U.S. 673, 74 L. Ed. 1107, 50 S. Ct. 451 (1930). Brinkerhoff stands for the proposition that a court cannot change a procedural rule so as to deprive a plaintiff of an otherwise valid cause of action without offending due process. However, this due process principle presupposes that the  plaintiff has a valid claim. Here, plaintiff has no valid claim for sexual orientation discrimination. Thus, the predicate for Brinkerhoff to apply, that the plaintiff have a valid cause of action that a retroactive change in procedural law now makes impossible to bring, is missing. Accordingly, Brinkerhoff is not germane to the situation before us in Mack.
Justice CAVANAGH also objects to the Court advancing legal theories not raised by the parties. I am mindful of the important role the adversarial process plays in our judicial system, particularly regarding the identification of disputed issues. Yet,  the adversarial process aids a court's legal resolution, it does not dictate it. Where the adversarial process fails to provide valuable assistance, a court's duty to correctly expound the law is not excused. Our case law clearly points this out:
It is well established that a court is not bound by the parties' stipulations of law. See, e.g.,  Rice v Ruddiman, 10 Mich. 125, 138 (1862), and  Bradway v Miller, 200 Mich. 648, 655;  167 N.W. 15 (1918). It is within the inherent power of a court, as the judicial body, to determine the applicable law in each case. To hold otherwise could lead to absurd results; for example, parties could force a court to apply laws that were in direct contravention to the laws of this state. It would also allow the parties to stipulate to laws that were obsolete, overruled, or unconstitutional. On the appellate level, this would result in a tremendous waste of judicial resources, since such case law would have no precedential value. [ In re Finlay Estate, 430 Mich. 590, 595-596, 424 N.W.2d 272 (1988)] 2 .
Just as parties cannot place the law beyond the reach of the Court by stipulation,  they cannot avoid the application of controlling law by failing to address it.
 Simply put, the issue of preemption by state law was squarely before this Court in Mack and the specific preemptive effect of governmental immunity was raised by the Court at oral argument. However, plaintiff failed adequately to explain to this Court why the governmental tort liability act did not prohibit the city's alleged creation of a cause of action for sexual orientation discrimination at either oral argument or, more tellingly, even in plaintiff's motion for rehearing. Plaintiff's adversarial shortcomings do not prevent this Court from following the law.
Further, I wish to point out how unusual is Justice CAVANAGH's assertion that our sua sponte raising and deciding the  McCummings v Hurley Medical Ctr, 433 Mich. 404, 446 N.W.2d 114 (1989), issue somehow runs afoul of some established "rule." If such a "rule" exists, it certainly is not one that the United States Supreme Court observes. I simply note by way of example that the United States Supreme Court has sua sponte raised and decided issues neither raised nor briefed by the parties on many occasions and in some  of the most important cases it has decided. See, for example,  Erie R Co v Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188, 58 S. Ct. 817 (1938), and  Mapp v Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 81 S. Ct. 1684;  86 Ohio Law Abs. 513 (1961). In fact, that Court recently addressed an issue that was not briefed by the parties and was raised only indirectly at oral argument by the Court, notwithstanding a dissent critical of the Court's doing so. See  Kolstad v American Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 540, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494, 119 S. Ct. 2118 (1999) (citing cases where the Court had previously done so, Justice O'Connor wrote for the majority that "the Court has not always confined itself to the set of issues addressed by the parties"). Likewise, this entire Court recently decided an issue not raised or briefed by the parties. See  Federated Publications, Inc v Lansing, 467 Mich. 98 (2002). As suggested above, the highest court's duty is to the law itself, not fidelity to the parties' vision (or lack thereof) of the law.
Justice CAVANAGH's assertion that this Court deprived plaintiff of a due process right by finding that she was required to plead in avoidance of governmental immunity ignores the precedent set by this Court. A point we did not make in Mack, but could have, is that a review of Michigan law before Mack would hardly suggest that plaintiff need not plead in avoidance of governmental immunity. As stated in Mack, the McCummings holding was an aberration in Michigan and largely ignored by Michigan courts after it was decided. Opinions from this Court post-McCummings support this conclusion and refute any contention that governmental immunity was established solely as an affirmative defense. This truth is evident, in part, because the Mack decision was foreshadowed in several recent cases that all stated that a plaintiff must plead in avoidance of governmental immunity. See  Hanson v Mecosta Co Rd Comm'rs, 465 Mich. 492, 499, 638 N.W.2d 396 (2002) ("A plaintiff making a claim of inadequate signage, like a plaintiff making a claim of inadequate street lighting or vegetation obstruction, fails to plead in avoidance of governmental immunity.") (quoting  Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm, 463 Mich. 143, 183, 615 N.W.2d 702 (2000));  Haliw v Sterling Heights, 464 Mich. 297, 304, 627 N.W.2d 581 [2001]) ("First, it must be determined whether the plaintiff has pleaded a cause of action in avoidance of governmental immunity."). In fact, although he criticizes the fact that we overruled McCummings in Mack, Justice CAVANAGH himself subscribed to the Mack postulate post-McCummings:
The governmental tort liability act, MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107),  waives the state's immunity from liability in certain limited areas. However, in order to successfully bring suit against an agency of the state, one has to plead in avoidance of governmental immunity and prove an underlying cause of action. See  Canon v Thumudo, 430 Mich. 326;  422 N.W.2d 688 (1988). [ Klinke v Mitsubishi Motors Corp, 458 Mich. 582, 615, n 19, 581 N.W.2d 272 (1998) ( KELLY, J., dissenting and CAVANAGH, J., concurring with Justice KELLY) (emphasis added)]. 3  
 In light of these recent opinions by this Court, it is doubtful that plaintiff had no notice of the appropriate procedural rule. 
Finally, Justice CAVANAGH's claim that the acts plaintiff complained of were ultra vires, and thus outside governmental immunity, is simply incorrect. The actions plaintiff challenged--"job reassignment, distribution of vacation time, and determining the extent to which department officers are involved with investigations---are quintessential governmental functions as they are inherent in running a police department.   467 Mich. at 204. The fact that the motivation to do one of these acts may have been the product of discriminatory animus does not convert the act itself into an ultra vires one.
For these reasons, I am unpersuaded by the arguments by plaintiff and Justice CAVANAGH and concur with the denial of the motion for rehearing.
