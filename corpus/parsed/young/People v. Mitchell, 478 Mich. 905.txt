YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the order denying leave to appeal. However, I write separately to note that I believe that the evidence proffered in this case may well have satisfied the Michigan corpus delicti rule. A defendant's confession may not be admitted unless there is direct  or circumstantial evidence independent of the confession establishing the occurrence of a specific injury and some criminal agency as the source of the injury. People v Konrad, 449 Mich. 263, 269-270; 536 N.W.2d 517 (1995). However, the elements need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and courts may draw reasonable inferences and weigh the probabilities. People v Mumford, 171 Mich. App. 514, 517; 430 N.W.2d 770 (1988). Moreover, it is not necessary to present independent evidence on all elements of the crime before the confession can be admitted. People v Williams, 422 Mich. 381, 391; 373 N.W.2d 567 (1985). Where the defendant makes admissions of fact that do not amount to confessions of guilt, those admissions may be admitted to prove the corpus delicti of the crime. People v Rockwell, 188 Mich. App. 405, 407; 470 N.W.2d 673 (1991). Nevertheless, rather than appeal the circuit court's ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence, the prosecutor concedes the point and asks that this Court adopt an alternative rule. As the evidence in this case would seem to satisfy the current corpus delicti rule, I see no basis for the intervention of this Court in this case.
