I would deny leave to appeal. Defendant filed a petition seeking DNA testing pursuant to MCL 770.16 in October 2002. The petition was granted in part and denied in part in April 2003. The trial court granted testing of the fingernail clippings, but unequivocally denied testing of the semen samples. In November 2003, the laboratory reported that the fingernail specimens were insufficient for testing. Sixteen months later, on March 22, 2005, defendant filed a second petition for DNA testing of the semen specimens, seeking to relitigate the identical issue that had been conclusively decided against the defendant two years previously.
When a petition for DNA testing has been denied, the statute provides only one avenue of recourse--an appeal to the Court of Appeals by leave granted. See MCL 770.16(9). Defendant was required to appeal the denial of his petition within 12 months of the entry of the denial order pursuant  to MCR 7.205(F)(3). Thus, the opportunity for the Court of Appeals to review the trial court's order denying the motion for testing of the semen samples was conclusively closed after April 25, 2004.
 Contrary to what occurred in this case, nothing in the statute permits the filing of serial petitions for DNA testing as a remedy for the denial of a previously filed petition. Because defendant has not complied with the only remedy provided by the statute, I conclude that defendant has waived appellate review of the issue. Additionally, I believe that permitting the filing of sequential petitions erroneously permits the relitigation of previously decided issues in contravention of our rules that preclude serial challenges of issues previously decided.
For these reasons, I would deny leave to appeal.
