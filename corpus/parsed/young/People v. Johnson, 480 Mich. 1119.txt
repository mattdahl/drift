YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the order and write solely to respond to Justice Kelly's dissent. This defendant has appealed to this Court and the Court of Appeals a number of times over the years since his conviction. The current application for leave to appeal is from defendant's fourth motion for relief from judgment. Considering the defendant's relative youth when he committed and was convicted of assault with intent to commit armed robbery, several justices have wondered why defendant has been incarcerated for so long. 1  This is a humane and understandable impulse but one that now trenches upon the discretionary authority of the Department of Corrections, which alone has the authority to determine when convicted felons will be paroled. This Court recently requested that the prosecutor provide an explanation "as to what has led the Department of Corrections to exercise its discretion to keep the defendant incarcerated until now." People v Johnson, 740 NW2d 310. As it turns out, this defendant has a lengthy and substantial record of prison violations, including violent assaults. So that the public will be able to assess the arguments Justice Kelly makes on his behalf, I attach hereto the summary of defendant's prison record provided by the prosecutor. [Attachment at the end of the order.]
