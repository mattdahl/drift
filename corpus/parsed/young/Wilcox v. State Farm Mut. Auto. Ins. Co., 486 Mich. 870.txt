Dissent




YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent from the order in this case and instead would deny leave to appeal. The order directs the parties to discuss whether Griffith v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co 1  was correctly decided. I believe it was correctly decided. While it is certainly the prerogative of the Court to reconsider this case, this order is another instance where the majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare decisis. 2  
 Since the shift in the Court's philosophical majority in January 2009, the majority has pointedly sought out precedents only recently decided 3   and has failed to give  effect to other recent precedents of this Court. 4  Today, the Court again orders reconsideration of a case that was decided just five years ago. It should be obvious to all but the most casual observer of the Court that a pattern is being established: the new majority is intent on "revisiting" (overruling) the decisions of the last ten years. Ironically, its consistent signals to the Bar that the jurisprudence of the last decade is in play seems an unnecessary prod to those who would eagerly return to the days when "judicial policy," rather than the language of the statute, ruled.
Other than the change in the composition of this Court in 2009, nothing in the law of this State or the rationale of that decision has changed in this short time. Accordingly, as I have in other similar orders, 5  I respectfully dissent from this order.
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
