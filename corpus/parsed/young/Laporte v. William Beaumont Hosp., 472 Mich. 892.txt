Because this matter is interlocutory, I concur in the denial. In Craig v Oakwood Hospital, 471 Mich. 67; 684 N.W.2d 296 (2004), and Gilbert v DaimlerChrysler Corp, 470 Mich. 749; 685 N.W.2d 391 (2004), this Court clearly set forth the role of the trial judge under MRE 702 and MCL 600.2955 to act as a gatekeeper to ensure that each aspect of an expert witness's proffered testimony -- including the data underlying the expert's theories and the methodology by which the expert draws conclusions from that data -- is  reliable. If, after the trial in this case, there is an application for leave to appeal establishing that the Oakland Circuit Court failed to adequately perform its role as a gatekeeper, these gatekeeping principles will be enforced.
