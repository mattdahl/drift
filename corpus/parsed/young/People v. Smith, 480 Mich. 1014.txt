  
Concur




YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the order scheduling oral argument on the application, but write separately because I fear that this Court is embarking on an impossible mission. This case raises the question whether a trial judge who articulates substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the sentencing guidelines range must sentence the defendant with such mathematical precision, by comparing the facts and circumstances of the defendant's crime against a hypothetically better or worse fact pattern, that the severity of his crime is perfectly matched with the extent of the departure. I do not believe that there is a principled way to achieve this mathematical precision, nor do I think that the guidelines statutes, properly construed, impose this burden on the trial judge.
WEAVER and CORRIGAN, JJ., join the statement of YOUNG, J.
