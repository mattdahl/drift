Concur




YOUNG, J. (concurring).
I concur in the order remanding this case for resentencing only because we are bound to do so under People v Francisco, 474 Mich 82; 711 N.W.2d 44 (2006). I write separately to reiterate my continued adherence to Justice CORRIGAN's dissenting opinion in Francisco. Just as in Francisco, the current defendant's minimum sentence falls within the corrected minimum sentencing guidelines range. Accordingly, but for Francisco, I would hold that any error in scoring the guidelines was harmless and deny leave to appeal.
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
