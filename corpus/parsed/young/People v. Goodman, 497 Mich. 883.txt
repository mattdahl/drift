Concur




Young, C.J. (concurring).
Given the current state of the law, I concur in the result. I write separately, however, to reiterate my disagreement with this Court's construction of the sentencing guidelines in People v Bonilla-Machado, 489 Mich 412; 803 N.W.2d 217 (2011), and People v Pearson, 490 Mich 984; 807 N.W.2d 45 (2012).
In those cases, I dissented from the portions of both decisions holding that the scoring of the relevant provisions of Offense Variable (OV) 13, MCL 777.43, is limited to only offenses categorized as offenses "against a person" or "against property." Bonilla-Machado, 489 Mich at 442 (Young, C.J., dissenting). Properly construed, the relevant provisions of OV 13 should be scored for charged crimes "involving" criminal activity against a person or property, regardless of the offense category. Id. at 449-450. Because Bonilla-Machado and Pearson are settled law, however, and because the trial court misapplied that law in this case, I concur in this Court's order remanding this case to the trial court.
