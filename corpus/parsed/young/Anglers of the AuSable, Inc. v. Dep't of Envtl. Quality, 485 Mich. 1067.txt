Dissent




YOUNG, J. (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent from the order granting leave in this case and instead would deny leave to appeal. The order directs the parties to discuss whether Michigan Citizens v Nestle Waters 1  and Preserve the Dunes v DEQ 2  were correctly decided. I believe both cases were correctly decided. While it is certainly the prerogative of the Court to do so, this order is another instance where the majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare decisis. 3  
 Since the shift in the Court's philosophical majority in January 2009, the majority has pointedly sought out precedents only recently decided 4  and has failed to give effect to other recent precedents of this Court. 5  Today, the Court again orders reconsideration of two cases that were decided just three and six years ago. Nothing in the law of this State or the rationale of those decisions has changed in this short time. Accordingly, as I have in other similar orders, 6  I respectfully dissent from this order.
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
