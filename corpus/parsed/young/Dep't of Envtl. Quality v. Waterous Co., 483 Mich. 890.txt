YOUNG, J. (concurring).
The question whether the statute, MCL 324.20120a(6), requires the defendant to remediate the property to a level consistent with a higher use than the defendant's historical use of the property is troubling. I concur with this Court's denial order because the defendant did not preserve a constitutional taking argument.
