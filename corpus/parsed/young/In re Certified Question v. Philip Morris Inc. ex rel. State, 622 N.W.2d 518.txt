Concur




Young, Jr., J., concurs and states as follows:
For the reasons set forth in Justice Weaver's dissenting statement in Proposed Amendment of MCR 7.305, 462 Mich. 1208 (2000), I continue to believe that this Court lacks constitutional authority to resolve certified questions under MCR 7.305(B). However, because that position did not carry the day, I concur in the order in this case requesting supplemental briefing and oral argument.
