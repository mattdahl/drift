YOUNG, J., concurs and states as follows:
I concur in the order remanding this case to the Genesee Circuit Court for resentencing because the plain language of MCR 6.302(C)(3) compels it. However, I question the reasoning and analytical underpinnings of the court rule, which is a codification of People v Killebrew, 416 Mich. 189; 330 N.W.2d 834 (1982). 
In this case, defendant pleaded guilty in exchange for a prosecutorial sentencing recommendation. The prosecution fulfilled its end of the agreement, recommending a sentence of probation with drug counseling. However, because the sentencing judge did not follow the nonbinding recommendation, our court rules mandate that defendant be permitted to withdraw a voluntarily, knowingly, and willingly entered guilty plea.
I cannot understand why a guilty plea given in exchange for a prosecutorial sentencing recommendation is vitiated by the court's disinclination to follow the recommendation. More important, I do not understand the rationale of Killebrew that a defendant, having obtained the benefit of a bargain with the prosecutor, can withdraw his plea when a court refuses to follow the recommendation. People v Cobbs, 443 Mich. 276; 505 N.W.2d 208 (1993), was decided after Killebrew and undermined the rationale underpinning Killebrew. The principles that make withdrawal possible under similar circumstances in a Cobbs plea, where the court is a party to the plea agreement, have no applicability in a Killebrew plea. I welcome the opportunity to address the reasoning and rationale of the Killebrew decision, and favor amending MCR 6.302(C)(3).
CORRIGAN, J., joins the statement of YOUNG, J.
WEAVER, J., would grant leave to appeal.
