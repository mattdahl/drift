YOUNG, J. (concurring).
While I concur with the order reversing the Workers' Compensation Appellate Commission, I write to note that Justice Weaver's dissenting statement is so breathtakingly and profoundly incoherent that it is hard to know how to respond to it.
Until today, I was not aware that a dissenting justice could purport (much less had the authority) to nullify a holding of a majority of this Court by simple declarative fiat. This order, signed by a majority of justices, overturns a Court of Appeals opinion which is inconsistent with Justice Weaver's published position in Simkins v Gen Motors Corp (After Remand), 453 Mich 703; 556 N.W.2d 839 (1996). Thus, it is hard to understand why Justice Weaver believes that this order is neither "precedential" nor "persuasive."
Given that it is entirely likely that I will soon be in the philosophical minority on this Court, I will take great pleasure citing and relying on Justice Weaver's odd legal doctrine under which the minority view controls.
