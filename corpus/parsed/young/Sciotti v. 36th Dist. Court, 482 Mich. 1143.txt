).
I concur in the Court' decision to deny the application for leave to appeal because the defendant is not entitled to the relief it seeks. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the lay opinion testimony of the defendant' former human resources administrator, and the defendant did not request any limiting instruction concerning her testimony. The defendant also acquiesced in the jury' consideration of the plaintiff' "statistical evidence." 16  Although the  defendant may have had a legal basis for excluding the "statistical evidence" as incompetent to establish an inference of racial discrimination, 17  such evidence was properly before the jury in the absence of an objection by the defendant. Finally, in agreeing on a general verdict, the defendant waived any right to have the jury individually assess each contested promotional decision. Therefore, the jury did not need to specify which of the defendant' promotional decisions violated the ban on racial discrimination in MCL 37.2202(1)(a).
Given the evidence properly before it, a reasonable jury could have found that at least one of the defendant' adverse promotional decisions violated the ban on racial discrimination in MCL 37.2202(1)(a). Accordingly, I concur in this Court' decision to deny the application for leave to appeal. The courts below correctly denied the defendant' motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
