Although I recognize that this Court's decision in People v Hill, 486 Mich 658, 786 N.W.2d 601 (2010), controls the interpretation of MCL 750.145c, I continue to adhere to the position stated in my dissenting opinion in that case that, like defendant here, a person who makes copies of child pornography thereby "produces" or "makes" child sexually abusive material sufficient to sustain a conviction under MCL 750.145c(2).
