I concur in certifying interpretation of the Texas statute at issue to the Texas Supreme Court because only that court can authoritatively interpret it. See, e.g., Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Admiral Ins. Co., 152 S.W.3d 172, 183 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, pet. denied) (explaining that federal diversity decisions are "instructive" but "not binding as precedent on Texas  state courts"). Unlike my colleagues, however, I find the statute amenable to a straightforward interpretation that I briefly set out below.
The statute in question provides for exemplary damages when a principal breaches a compensation agreement with a sales representative: the principal becomes liable for "three times the unpaid commission due the sales representative," as well as attorney's fees and costs. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 54.004(1), (2). In this case the principal concededly failed to pay commissions by the deadline in the parties' agreement, but eventually repaid all late commissions with interest (some after suit had been filed). The question is whether, in this scenario, the principal is still liable for "three times the unpaid commission due." The district court said "no," reasoning that the principal's eventual payment of the late commissions meant there were no longer any commissions left "unpaid"—i.e., nothing still "due" and so nothing to treble. JCB, Inc. v. Horsburgh & Scott Co., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 218472, 2017 WL 6805045, at *5 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 25, 2017) (holding that "the commission is not 'unpaid' or 'due' because, as both parties agree, it has been paid with interest").
While declining to endorse the district court's reading of the statute, the majority reasons that the key phrase "unpaid commission due" in Section 54.004 leaves unanswered exactly when a commission becomes "due" for treble liability purposes. The majority suggests various possibilities—perhaps the relevant time is "at the moment the commission is owed," or "within some reasonable grace period" afterwards, or "at the time the suit is filed," or "when the principal is held liable for unpaid commissions."
In my view, the text and structure of the statute provide the necessary answers to such timing questions. Naturally, Texas courts read statutory phrases, not in isolation, but in "the context and framework of the entire statute." Cadena Comercial USA Corp. v. Tex. Alcoholic Beverage Comm'n, 518 S.W.3d 318, 326 (Tex. 2018); see also, e.g., State v. Gonzalez, 82 S.W.3d 322, 327 (Tex. 2002) (statutory meaning is gleaned "from the entire act and not just from isolated portions"); Jones v. Fowler, 969 S.W.2d 429, 432 (Tex. 1998) (Texas courts "read the statute as a whole and interpret it to give effect to every part"); see also, e.g., Occidental Chem. Corp. v. Elliott Turbomachinery Co., 84 F.3d 172, 175 (5th Cir. 1996) (our court must interpret a state statute "the way the [state] [s]upreme [c]ourt would interpret the statute") (brackets added). Thus, a Texas court would interpret the phrase "unpaid commission due" by reading it in context and within the surrounding statutory  framework. Those contextual and structural clues show what the phrase means.
Notably, Section 54.004 makes treble liability turn on the operation of two other sections. A principal is liable for "three times the unpaid commission due" the sales representative only if the principal (1) "fails to comply with a provision of a contract under Section 54.002 relating to payment of a commission," or (2) "fails to pay a commission as required by Section 54.003." Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 54.004. The cross-referenced sections address two distinct scenarios. Section 54.002 mandates that a compensation agreement be "in writing or in a computer-based medium," that it "state the method by which the sales representative's commission is to be computed and paid," and that a copy be given the representative. Id. §§ 54.002(a)(1), (a)(2), (b). By contrast, Section 54.003 concerns agreements that do not comply with the section 54.002 requirements and provides that, if such an agreement is terminated, "the principal shall pay all commissions due the sales representative not later than the 30th  working day after the date of the termination." Id. § 54.003.
The interplay of these linked sections illustrates what "unpaid commission due" means in Section 54.004.
First, take a principal's breach under Section 54.002. In that scenario, Section 54.004 links treble liability for "the unpaid commission due" to the principal's "fail[ure] to comply with a provision of a contract ... relating to payment of a commission." Id. § 54.004 (emphasis added). And Section 54.002 tells us that the contract must contain "the method by which the sales representative's commission is to be ... paid." Id. § 54.002(a)(2). So, connecting the dots between Sections 54.004 and 54.002, it appears that a commission becomes "due" precisely when the relevant "provision" in the parties' contract makes it due. That is just how the statute would work here: the parties' compensation agreement sets the commission deadline "on approximately the 10th of each month following the payment of a commissionable order," and so the principal would be liable for three times any commission unpaid by that agreed-upon deadline.1 
Second, take a principal's breach under Section 54.003. (This is the section concerning agreements that do not comply with the Section 54.002 requirements.) In this scenario, Section 54.004 makes treble liability turn on a principal's failure to pay a commission "as required by Section 54.003." And Section 54.003 spells out that "all commissions due" are to be paid "not later than the 30th working day after the date of termination." Id. § 54.003. So, connecting the dots between Sections 54.004 and 54.003, it appears that an unpaid commission would be "due" for treble liability purposes no more than 30 working days after termination. In that situation, even if a principal paid all outstanding commissions on the 31st working day after termination, the principal would still be liable—by the statute's plain terms—for triple the "unpaid commissions" that had been "due" the day before.
To sum up: the two sections cross-referenced by Section 54.004 combine to give content to the phrase "unpaid commission due" that varies depending on the scenario presented. If there is a Section 54.002 breach of a provision stating when commissions are to be paid, then it is the parties' agreement that determines when  an "unpaid commission" is "due." That is the scenario presented here. On the other hand, if there is a Section 54.003 failure to abide by the statutory 30-day time-limit, then the statute itself determines when an "unpaid commission" is "due." Read this way, the two sections are complementary: Section 54.003 addresses a scenario where the parties' agreement—unlike one compliant with Section 54.002—fails to specify the "method by which the sale representative's commission is to be ... paid," and thus provides a one-size-fits-all answer to the question of when an unpaid commission is "due" for treble liability purposes. In either case, the statutory text and structure establish an objective benchmark for determining the timing (and hence the measure) of treble damages under Section 54.004.
One might object that this interpretation will lead to harsh results. After all, it would mean that a principal becomes triply liable for a commission paid even one day after the agreed-upon deadline (or, alternatively, one day after the statutory 30-day period, if it applies). There are several responses. First, that result may not seem so harsh if you are a sales representative  dependent on commissions for your livelihood. You would welcome the statute's rigor because it would encourage principals to pay on time the money they owe you (money they already have in their pockets thanks to your efforts). Second, this strict result is consistent with other states' sales representative acts. See, e.g., Ga. Code § 10-1-702(b)(1), (2) (providing recovery as exemplary damages for "double the amount not timely paid as required"); Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.2961(5)(b) ("[i]f the principal is found to have intentionally failed to pay the commission when due," awarding as exemplary damages "an amount equal to 2 times the amount of commissions due but not paid as required"). Third, if the Texas Legislature wished to write a more lenient provision, it knew how. See, e.g., Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 17.50(b)(1) (allowing consumer to recover treble damages for certain deceptive trade practices if "the conduct was committed intentionally"). Finally, how "harsh" a provision ought to be—especially a provision so evidently punitive as this one—is a policy judgment left up to representative political bodies.2  We judges, by contrast, "must take statutes as we find them[.]" Texas Lottery Comm'n v. First State Bank of DeQueen, 325 S.W.3d 628, 637 (Tex. 2010); see also, e.g., Turner v. Cross, 83 Tex. 218, 18 S.W. 578, 579 (Tex. 1892) (explaining that "the only safe rule is to apply to [words] their ordinary meaning ... and if,  so applying them, the legislation in which they are found seems to be harsh, the courts are not authorized to place on them a forced construction for the purposes of mitigating a seeming hardship") (cleaned up).3 
I respectfully concur.
