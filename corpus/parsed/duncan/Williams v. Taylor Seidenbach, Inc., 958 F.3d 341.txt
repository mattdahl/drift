We took this case en banc to address the so-called "finality trap." We needed to do so to exorcise the "ghostly magic" that prevents certain dismissals from becoming appealable. Williams v. Taylor Seidenbach, Inc. (Williams II), 935 F.3d 358, 361 (5th Cir. 2019) (Haynes, J., concurring), vacated on rehearing en banc, 941 F.3d 1183 (5th Cir. 2019). For whatever reason, the majority gave up that ghost. Instead, it authorizes a district court to grant a Rule 54(b) motion filed after the conclusion of a case. We didn't do that in Swope. The Seventh Circuit didn't do it in ITOFCA either. No federal court has ever done that before—not one time since the adoption of Rule 54(b) in 1939. With greatest respect for my learned colleagues, I dissent.
I.
Today's decision conflicts with foundational rules and statutes governing our jurisdiction. Let's start with Rule 41(a). The majority ignores that Rule's text. And in so doing, it exercises jurisdiction in a way that Article III prohibits.
A.
Rule 41(a) provides that "an action may be dismissed [by court order] at the plaintiff's request." Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) (emphasis added); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 41(a)(1)(A) (setting out the circumstances in which a "plaintiff may dismiss an action"). The Williamses and the district court purported to rely on Rule 41(a) "to dismiss the remaining claim" in the case. Ante, at 7 (majority op.) (emphasis added). That was the first mistake—an action is not synonymous with a claim.
Rule 41(a) allows a plaintiff to dismiss an "action." Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2). An "action" is the entire lawsuit, not just one part of it. See Action, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (defs. 3 & 4). A "claim," by contrast, is a subpart of the action. Id. at Claim (def. 3) (defining "claim" as a "part of a complaint in a civil action"); see also Ryan v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 577 F.2d 298, 302 n.2 (5th Cir. 1978) (describing a "claim" as "a fragment of an action").
The Rules employ this distinction. For example, the subsection that immediately follows in Rule 41 gives the defendant the choice between "mov[ing] to dismiss the action or any claim against it" in the event "plaintiff fails to prosecute." Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) (emphasis added). And Rule 54 contemplates an instance "[w]hen an action presents more than one claim for relief." FED R. CIV. P. 54(b); see also Exxon Corp. v. Md. Cas. Co., 599 F.2d 659, 662 (5th Cir. 1979) ("When Rule 41(a) refers to dismissal of an 'action,' there is no reason to suppose that the term is intended to include the separate claims which make up an action. When dismissal of a claim is intended, as in Rule 41(b), that concept is spelled out in plain language." (quotation omitted)).
Rule 41(a) therefore does not allow a plaintiff to pick and choose among claims as candidates for dismissal: Under the Rule, it's dismissal of the action, or of nothing at all. See Perry v. Schumacher Grp. of La., 891 F.3d 954, 958 (11th Cir.  2018) ("It is clear from the text that only an 'action' may be dismissed. There is no mention in the Rule of the option to [dismiss] a portion of a plaintiff's lawsuit—e.g., a particular claim—while leaving a different part of the lawsuit pending before the trial court."); Berthold Types Ltd. v. Adobe Sys. Inc., 242 F.3d 772, 777 (7th Cir. 2001) (Easterbrook, J.) (Rule [41(a)] does not speak of dismissing one claim in a suit; it speaks of dismissing 'an action'—which is to say, the whole case."); State Treasurer of Mich. v. Barry, 168 F.3d 8, 15 (11th Cir. 1999) (in a case where a party attempted to use Rule 41(a) to dismiss an individual claim, noting that "Rule 41 is not meant for the use the parties in this case and others like it have put it: the rule speaks of voluntary dismissal of 'an action,' not a claim") (quotation omitted)); Harvey Aluminum, Inc. v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 203 F.2d 105, 108 (2d Cir. 1953) ("Rule 41(a) . . . provides for the voluntary dismissal of an 'action' not a 'claim'; the word 'action' as used in the Rules denotes the entire controversy, whereas 'claim' refers to what has traditionally been termed 'cause of action.'").
This inability to dismiss individual claims under Rule 41(a) is not as harsh as it may at first seem. As the majority notes, ante, at 7, the Rules provide other routes to a plaintiff looking to dismiss undesirable claims or parties. Rule 15 explains how a party may "amend its pleading." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1); see also Perry, 891 F.3d at 958 ("There are multiple ways to dismiss a single claim without dismissing an entire action. The easiest and most obvious is to seek and obtain leave to amend the complaint to eliminate the remaining claim, pursuant to Rule 15."); Ryan, 577 F.2d at 302 n.2 (noting that "the plaintiff's elimination of a fragment of an action . . . is more appropriately considered to be an amendment to the complaint under Rule 15"). And Rule 21 lets the district court, "[o]n a motion or on its own, . . . add or drop a party." Fed. R. Civ. P. 21; see also Harvey Aluminum, 203 F.2d at 108 (suggesting that plaintiffs use Rule 21, rather than Rule 41, to eliminate a party from a multiparty action). We need not stretch Rule 41(a) beyond its text to do the work of other Rules.
B.
When a plaintiff sidesteps these other routes and chooses to proceed via Rule 41(a), he chooses to dismiss the entire action—every single claim in the case. That choice has consequences: It deprives us of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
For a case or controversy to engage our Article III jurisdiction, there must be adversity, "extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed." Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997) (quotation omitted). A case becomes moot, and non-adverse, "when the issues are no longer live . . . [n]o matter how vehemently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the conduct that precipitated the lawsuit . . . ." Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91, 133 S. Ct. 721, 184 L. Ed. 2d 553 (2013) (quotation omitted).
One way a party can moot a case is to agree not to proceed with it. That's why a settlement terminates Article III jurisdiction. See Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2009). So does the issuance of "a covenant not to sue." Already, LLC, 568 U.S. at 90. Under this rubric, a voluntary dismissal with prejudice plainly moots a case: "When the plaintiffs ask[] the District Court to dismiss their claims, they consent[] to the judgment against them and disavow[] any right to relief . . . ." Microsoft Corp. v. Baker,  137 S. Ct. 1702, 1717, 198 L. Ed. 2d 132 (2017) (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment).
So too for voluntary dismissals without prejudice. Although the plaintiff "is entitled to bring a later suit on the same cause of action," he has agreed that this one should go no further. Ryan, 577 F.2d at 302. It follows, then, that a Rule 41(a) dismissal represents a voluntary abandonment of the entire action, and deprives us of jurisdiction over any element of the dispute. If, as the parties and the majority assume, we are dealing with an appeal from a Rule 41(a) dismissal, we have no constitutional authority to hear this case.
C.
The majority does not disagree with this interpretation of Rule 41(a). It merely feigns surprise that I would raise an argument not raised by the parties themselves. But a correct understanding of Rule 41(a) has jurisdictional consequences, so we have an independent obligation to get it right, regardless of the parties' views. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly reminded us: "Every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it." Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 95, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (quotation omitted). So the majority cannot ignore the problem just because the parties did so.
Nor does it matter that we've previously misread Rule 41(a). See, e.g., Plains Growers, Inc. v. Ickes-Braun Glasshouses, Inc., 474 F.2d 250 (5th Cir. 1973). In Plains Growers, we rejected a textualist approach to Rule 41(a)(1) and pursued instead "[t]he purpose of the Rule." Id. at 254. At least in 1973, we found "[t]he purpose" of the Rule was "to permit the plaintiff voluntarily to take the case out of court if no other party will be prejudiced." Ibid.1  So we allowed a plaintiff to use Rule 41 to dismiss a single defendant without dismissing the entire "action" because, in our view, that was the result "intended by the rule-makers." Id. at 255. Such purposivist-cum-intent-of-the-framers reasoning was quite common in the 1970s. See, e.g., Train v. Colo. Pub. Interest Research Grp., Inc., 426 U.S. 1, 10, 96 S. Ct. 1938, 48 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1976) (reversing the court of appeals because it "excluded reference to the legislative history of the [law] in discerning its meaning"); Philbrook v Glodgett, 421 US 707, 713, 95 S. Ct. 1893, 44 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1975) ("Our objective . . . is to ascertain the congressional intent and give effect to the legislative will."); Antonin Scalia & Bryan Garner, Reading Law 383 (2012) (describing  the 1970s and 1980s as the "heyday of legislative history"). But even in those days, when we adopted a purpose-first approach to Rule 41, we found the textualist argument "persuasive." Plains Growers, 474 F.2d at 254.
The text of Rule 41(a) is more than persuasive; it's determinative. Purposivism has been out of fashion for a long time. And the whole reason we went en banc in this case was to revisit our jurisdictional precedents—as we have many times in the past. See, e.g., Williams v. Catoe, 946 F.3d 278 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (overturning a 1985 panel opinion on appellate jurisdiction over district court orders denying counsel to civil plaintiffs); Smallwood v. Illinois Cent. R.R. Co., 385 F.3d 568 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (reconsidering panel precedent on district court jurisdiction over certain in-state defendants in diversity cases); Marathon Oil Co. v. Ruhrgas, 145 F.3d 211, 215 (5th Cir. 1998) (en banc) (using en banc review to "reconcile the conflicting circuit precedent" regarding the adjudication of motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction), rev'd 526 U.S. 574, 119 S. Ct. 1563, 143 L. Ed. 2d 760 (1999); Newpark Shipbuilding & Repair, Inc. v. Roundtree, 723 F.2d 399 (5th Cir. 1984) (en banc) (harmonizing circuit precedent on the finality requirement for review of Benefits Review Board orders); United States v. Mendoza, 581 F.2d 89 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc) (going en banc to review panel precedent concerning district court jurisdiction over motions to reduce sentence).
We have an independent obligation to right our jurisdictional wrongs. This case provides us with an opportunity to do so. It is therefore of no moment that the parties have nothing to say about the issue, or that outmoded panel precedent goes the other way.
II.
Next, let's talk about Rule 54(b). The majority's approach finds no support in that Rule's text, its 81-year history, or precedent.
A.
The text of Rule 54(b) says: "When an action presents more than one claim for relief—whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim—or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties . . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (emphases added). In the majority's view, a Rule 54(b) certification is available even after every single claim pending before the district court has been dismissed.
No. Since the adoption of Rule 54(b) in 1939,2  that Rule has never authorized an appeal at the end of a case. As Justice Jackson explained, Rule 54(b) allows an  appeal before "the determination of all issues as to all parties" and "before a final judgment can be had." Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U.S. 507, 511, 70 S. Ct. 322, 94 L. Ed. 299 (1950) (emphasis added).
The italicized phrases in Rule 54(b) above tell you everything you need to know. First, "[w]hen an action presents more than one claim." That is, the action must—in the present tense—present more than one claim. It's insufficient that the action might have presented more than one claim in the past. It must present more than one claim now. Of course, if the plaintiff has dismissed the action under Rule 41(a), then the action presents zero claims—there isn't an action at all.
Let's imagine, then, that the Williamses instead used Rule 15 or 21 to modify their complaint and remove the remaining, unresolved claims from the action. Then what? Rule 54(b) kicks in only when the court can direct entry of final judgment "as to one or more, but fewer than all" the claims. Obviously, the district court can do that only if other claims remain pending. When the plaintiff instead uses Rules 15 and 21 to strip out the unresolved parties and claims from the complaint,3  there are no other claims "present[ed]" in the action. No Rule 54(b) order is permissible, or even necessary: At the end of the case, when all the claims have been dismissed, the district court is no longer directing entry of judgment on "fewer than all claims"; it's just entering judgment. SeeFed. R. Civ. P. 58; 10 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 54.22[2][c], at 73 (3d ed. 2020) [hereinafter Moore's Federal Practice] ("[I]f the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the unadjudicated claims against the other defendants, an earlier order as to one or more but fewer than all defendants becomes appealable despite the absence of a Rule 54(b) judgment.").
Perhaps the most damning piece of text is the one thing the district court must find in every Rule 54(b) certification: "that there is no just reason for delay." Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Now that makes sense when Rule 54(b) is applied—as it always has been—to partial appeals. But what possible work does the no-just-reason-for-delay requirement serve when all the claims in the case have already been decided? Of course there's no reason to delay the appeal then—because there's nothing left to do but appeal. Imagine getting to the end of a movie, watching the credits run to the end, and then seeing a screen permitting you to leave the theater "if there's no just reason for delay." What else were you going to do?
After today, it's unclear how to apply the current no-just-reason-for-delay caselaw, all of which is predicated on the existence of undismissed claims pending in the district court. Consider:
• The Supreme Court says that the district court, while mulling over a Rule 54(b) motion, may consider the amount of time "the rest of the litigation would be expected to continue." Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 11, 100 S. Ct. 1460, 64 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1980). Of course, that makes no sense if there's nothing left to litigate in the district court.
• Courts of appeals should "scrutinize the district court's evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship" between the adjudicated claims and the unadjudicated claims. Id. at 10.  How can they, when there are no unadjudicated claims outstanding?
• Some courts ask whether "the need to review the issues currently appealed may be mooted by future developments in the district court." Sussex Drug Prods. v. Kanasco, Ltd., 920 F.2d 1150, 1156 (3d Cir. 1990); see also Consol. Rail Corp. v. Fore River Ry. Co., 861 F.2d 322, 326 (1st Cir. 1988) (similar). How does that work when there's nothing left to develop in the district court?
I suppose we'll have to wait for another en banc petition to figure out the answers to these questions.
B.
The majority attempts to square its position with the text of the Rule. It can't.
The majority's textualist argument for its use of Rule 54(b) goes something like this: (1) a dismissed claim technically remains part of the complaint, "absent amendment," ante, at 9; (2) so even when all claims have been dismissed, an action may still "present[] more than one claim for relief," Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); and (3) that means, even when the entire case is dismissed, "fewer than all the claims" have been "adjudicate[d]"—so Rule 54(b) certification is available, ibid.; see ante, at 9 ("[A] voluntary dismissal of some defendants under Rule 41(a) at the end of the case does not alter the court's Rule 54(b) authority in any way."). Every single proposition in that argument is wrong.
Proposition (1) is wrong because a Rule 41(a) dismissal gets rid of the entire action, so there's no operative complaint to speak of. See supra Part I.A. Proposition (2) is wrong because, when all claims have been dismissed, the action no longer "presents more than one claim for relief"—it presents none at all. See supra Part II.A. Still, even if (1) and (2) are correct, Proposition (3) is wrong: a court-ordered dismissal under Rule 41(a) of all remaining claims "adjudicates" those claims, foreclosing Rule 54(b) relief.
Rule 54(b) is clear: "any order or other decision . . . that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action . . . and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment . . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). So if an order does adjudicate whatever claims remain, it ends the action and may not be revised. To "adjudicate" simply means "[t]o rule on judicially." Adjudicate, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). That word, as it is used by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, requires only a decision by the court—it does not require a decision on the merits. That's why the Rules take pains to indicate when an adjudication is also a merits decision. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(B) (providing that a plaintiff's first voluntary dismissal of a claim is "without prejudice," but a second dismissal of that claim "operates as an adjudication on the merits" (emphasis added)).
In this case, the district court dismissed the action under Rule 41(a). That obviously constituted a judicial ruling. It follows, then, that the Rule 41(a) dismissal "adjudicated" the plaintiffs' claims. And because there were no claims pending after that adjudication, Rule 54(b) was (and still is) completely irrelevant. See 10 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2656 (4th ed.) [hereinafter Wright & Miller] (observing that "no [Rule 54(b)] certificate is needed if no claims remain pending").
C.
Precedent does not save the majority, either. The Supreme Court has told us:  Once all claims have been dismissed, the "action is no longer pending"—even if the dismissals are voluntary and without prejudice. Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 395, 110 S. Ct. 2447, 110 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1990). And the termination of the action through voluntary dismissal means that the district court loses the power to tinker with the merits of the case. Id. at 396.
This unambiguous description of district court jurisdiction makes swift work of the majority's view that a voluntarily dismissed claim remains pending. Compare ante, at 9 ("A dismissed claim remains a part of the case . . . and that is so regardless of when the Rule 41(a) dismissal occurs."), with Yesh Music v. Lakewood Church, 727 F.3d 356, 360 & n.5 (5th Cir. 2013) (observing that a "voluntary dismissal terminates, closes, and ends [plaintiff's] cause of action," and that "it ends the pending action" (quotation omitted)), and DIRECTV, Inc. v. Budden, 420 F.3d 521, 524-26 (5th Cir. 2005) (considering Rule 54(b) inapplicable when summary judgment had been granted on some claims and "the remaining claims ha[d] already been abandoned").
Against the text of Rule 54(b) and an unbroken line of cases spanning the Rule's 81-year lifetime, the majority offers two authorities: our decision in Swope v. Columbian Chems. Co., 281 F.3d 185 (5th Cir. 2002), and the Seventh Circuit's decision in ITOFCA, Inc. v. MegaTrans Logistics, Inc., 235 F.3d 360 (7th Cir. 2000). But the very most that can be said about Swope is that it was a drive-by jurisdictional ruling on its way to an altogether different question about premature notices of appeal. And ITOFCA was not a Rule 54(b) case at all.
Take Swope. In that case, the district court granted summary judgment on fewer than all claims and left one claim pending. 281 F.3d at 190. The plaintiffs then filed three things: (1) a notice of appeal from the summary-judgment rulings, (2) a request that the district court certify those rulings as final judgments under Rule 54(b), and (3) a Rule 41(a) motion to dismiss the one undismissed claim. Id. at 190-91. The district court granted (2) and (3). Ibid. But defendants moved to dismiss the appeal based on (1): They argued we lacked jurisdiction "because appellants' notice of appeal preceded the trial court's designation of its summary judgment decisions as final." Id. at 191.
Our decision likewise focused on (1)—the premature notice of appeal. We recognized that a notice of appeal should ordinarily be filed only after a final decision, not before it. Ibid.; seeFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) ("[T]he notice of appeal . . . must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from." (emphasis added)). But the panel permitted the appeal to proceed anyway, applying a narrow exception "that a premature notice of appeal is effective if Rule 54(b) certification is subsequently granted." Swope, 281 F.3d at 191 (quotation omitted). The rest of Swope's analysis was the sort of "drive-by jurisdictional ruling[]" that has "no precedential effect." Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 91.
And as drive-by jurisdictional decisions go, this one undercuts the majority in three important ways. First, the Rule 54(b) motion in Swope was filed before the Rule 41(a) motion was granted. That timing matters. Before the district court granted the Rule 41(a) motion, it still had jurisdiction over the case. See supra Part I. And before the district court granted the Rule 41(a) motion, it had "adjudicate[d] fewer than all the claims" under Rule 54(b).
Second, the Swope court agreed with my reading of Rule 41(a). See 281 F.3d at 192  n.15. It recognized that the text of "Rule 41(a) contemplates dismissal of an 'action' rather than a 'claim' or 'claims.'" Ibid. And it recognized that our court previously interpreted Rule 41(a) to permit only dismissal of actions, not claims. See ibid. (citing, inter alia, Ryan, 577 F.2d at 302 n.2). The Swope court thought it needn't address this problem because the district court granted its Rule 54(b) certification and its Rule 41(a) dismissal on the same day, and the former sufficed to create finality. See 281 F.3d at 192 & n.15. That obviously says nothing about our problem—where the Williamses filed their Rule 54(b) motion years after dismissing the entire "action" under Rule 41(a). And in all events, Swope's agreement with my reading of Rule 41(a) makes the majority's embrace of the decision quite awkward.
Finally, as the majority concedes, the Swope panel expressly declined to consider how or why a valid Rule 41(a) dismissal might deprive the district court of jurisdiction and thereby render a subsequent Rule 54(b) certification a nullity. See ante, at 9 (quoting Swope, 281 F.3d at 192 n.15). That's understandable—the Swope panel was focused on the interplay between Rule 54(b) and notices of appeal, not between Rules 41(a) and 54(b). But it also means that Swope does not support, much less dictate, today's result.
Even less relevant is ITOFCA. See ante, at 10 (relying on the decision). The district court in that case did not enter a Rule 54(b) certification at all, so the Seventh Circuit had no occasion to exercise jurisdiction over such a certification. In fact, the Seventh Circuit held it had no jurisdiction at all and dismissed the appeal of a non-final decision under § 1291. So the only part of the ITOFCA decision that today's majority invokes is its dicta about some other hypothetical case that might be appealable under § 1291. And even that dicta was equivocal: The Seventh Circuit said "Rule 54(b) would seem to be an adequate alternative means of gaining appellate jurisdiction" in some other hypothesized case. 235 F.3d at 364 (emphasis added). That subjunctive aside is hardly a firm foundation for today's decision.
All this is to say: If we went en banc to ensure that our court's decisions are uniform and correct, seeFed. R. App. P. 35(a), uncritical reliance on Swope and ITOFCA isn't going to cut it.
III.
If the majority opinion is remarkable for what it does not do—follow the plain meaning of Rule 54(b), as recognized in an unbroken line of decisions spanning eight decades—it is more remarkable for what it does do. The new rules of civil procedure announced today will confer on district courts perpetual jurisdiction over long-dismissed claims. It also permits an end-run around the limits of our appellate jurisdiction set by Congress.
A.
Until today, the contours of district court jurisdiction were well-defined: While claims are pending, a court may exercise its authority over an action. See Cooter & Gell, 496 U.S. at 395. Once all claims are dismissed, however, the court may only "consider collateral issues," such as Rule 11 sanctions and requests for attorney's fees. Ibid. No more. The majority's regime imbues district courts with perpetual jurisdiction over long-dead claims.
Imagine, as the majority does, that Rule 41(a) permits piecemeal dismissals of individual claims within a multi-claim action. And suppose a plaintiff brings an action with three claims. Claim 1 and Claim 2 are adjudicated at summary judgment, but  Claim 3 survives and remains pending. If the parties stipulate to dismiss Claim 3 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), it is well-settled that, "[a]fter the dismissal, the action no longer is pending in the district court and no further proceedings in the action are proper." 9 Wright & Miller § 2367 (3d ed.); see also ibid. (collecting cases). That's because "[a] stipulation of dismissal under that rule ordinarily—and automatically—strips the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction." Nat'l City Golf Fin. v. Scott, 899 F.3d 412, 415-16 (5th Cir. 2018). This rule is so airtight that "any action by the district court" on the merits of the case "after the filing of such a stipulation can have no force or effect . . . ." SmallBizPros, Inc. v. MacDonald, 618 F.3d 458, 463 (5th Cir. 2010). So, under settled, near-unanimous precedent, there's nothing more to be done. The case is over.
Now consider the majority's approach. Under that understanding of Rule 54(b), the case is never final because there's no "final judgment," all claims remain pending before the district court, and that court retains jurisdiction over those claims forever. What's to stop a plaintiff from moving for a Rule 54(b) order years after dismissal of the entire action? Or a district court from granting it? That's precisely what happened in this case, and that's precisely the sort of never-ending litigation the majority opinion condones.
It's unclear how appeals are even supposed to work in this brave new world. In our hypothetical case, once Claim 3 is dismissed, when does the 30-day clock for filing a notice of appeal start to run? It should be obvious that the answer is when Count 3 is dismissed—the whole reason we went en banc was because current Fifth Circuit precedent (unmodified by today's opinion) tells us that the voluntary dismissal of the last remaining claim makes the action "final" within the district court. See Williams II, 935 F.3d at 361 (Haynes, J., concurring). But, again, under the majority's approach, because there's no "final judgment," the action never becomes final in the district court, and that court retains jurisdiction in perpetuity—at least until it grants a Rule 54(b) order.
B.
These problems hint at another unacceptable result of the majority opinion: The greatly diminished role of 28 U.S.C. § 1291, a congressionally imposed limit to our appellate jurisdiction.
1.
The majority's theory is that only "final judgments" may proceed through § 1291, while other final orders need Rule 54(b) certification to be appealable. Wrong again.
Congress gave us appellate jurisdiction over the "final decisions of the district courts of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (emphasis added). As a general matter, "[d]ismissals without prejudice are canonically non-final and hence not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291." Am. States Ins. Co. v. Capital Assocs. of Jackson Cty., Inc., 392 F.3d 939, 940 (7th Cir. 2004) (Easterbrook, J.). That is so because "without prejudice" is shorthand for "without prejudice to refiling." See Dismissal, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (defining "dismissal without prejudice" as "[a] dismissal that does not bar the plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit . . . ."). And the very potentiality of refiling makes the decision not "final." See Ryan, 577 F.2d at 302.
As with all general rules, however, this one has an exception. Some without-prejudice dismissals are final. Take subject-matter jurisdiction, for example. If a party fails to allege subject-matter jurisdiction, it  fails to properly invoke the machinery of the Article III courts. And when that happens, the plaintiff is not entitled to a judgment on the merits or a with-prejudice dismissal.4  It's entitled to nothing. That's why we merely announce the fact and dismiss. Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506, 514, 19 L. Ed. 264 (1868). That decision is obviously "final" because the district court is forever done with it. So the plaintiff can appeal under § 1291. See, e.g., 16 Front Street, LLC v. Miss. Silicon, LLC, 886 F.3d 549, 561 (5th Cir. 2018).
The text of § 1291 demands the distinction between "final decisions" and "final judgments." Congress could have written § 1291 to give us appellate jurisdiction only over "final judgments." That obviously would prevent appeals where the district court dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction and hence for lack of judicial power to enter a judgment. Of course, that's not the statute Congress wrote. It used the broader term "final decisions"—and with it, gave us judicial power over some without-prejudice dismissals, and some orders that aren't dismissals at all. See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528 (holding that § 1291 permits appeals from certain decisions "collateral to[] rights asserted in the action," even when there's no final judgment); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985) (holding "that a district court's denial of a claim of qualified immunity . . . is an appealable 'final decision' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment").
The line between final and non-final dismissals can be difficult to draw. See, e.g., 15A Wright & Miller § 3914.6 (2d ed.). And this difficulty can lead to mistakes in the district court. Often, for example, a district court will announce its lack of jurisdiction, dismiss the case without prejudice, and then purport to enter a "final judgment" under Rule 58. See, e.g., Warren v. Am. Bankers Ins. of Fla., 507 F.3d 1239, 1243 (10th Cir. 2007) (opining that the district court should have entered a Rule 58 judgment after dismissing the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction). That last step is obviously wrong because, again, the lack of jurisdiction means the lack of federal judicial power to do anything beyond announce the fact and dismiss. See Am. Nat'l Bank of Jacksonville v. FDIC, 710 F.2d 1528, 1535-36 (11th Cir. 1983) (observing that final judgments are unnecessary when an action is dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction). True, the entry of a purported "judgment" clearly communicates to the parties and to us that the district court is done and that its decision is "final" for purposes of § 1291. The important point for present purposes, however, is that the existence of a without-prejudice dismissal—standing alone—tells us nothing about whether it's appealable under § 1291.
The fact that some without-prejudice dismissals may create appealable final decisions under § 1291 poses another problem for the majority. The majority's theory  is that without-prejudice dismissals are never final or appealable until "final judgment" has been entered, see ante, at 8, hence the need for Rule 54(b) certification. But if dismissals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction don't need an accompanying final judgment to be final and appealable, how can the majority be correct? It can't and it's not. A dismissal that gets rid of all claims pending before the district court strips away the district court's power to enter a Rule 54(b) order, judgment or no judgment.
2.
All this is to say: The majority's misreading vastly expands Rule 54(b)'s reach. In so doing, our court impermissibly undermines the policy decisions Congress made when it enacted 28 U.S.C. § 1291.
The existence of our Court is constitutionally permitted but not constitutionally required. SeeU.S. Const. art. III, § 1. By virtue of the Madisonian Compromise, "the creation of lower federal courts" was "left to the wisdom of Congress." Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729, 746, 129 S. Ct. 2108, 173 L. Ed. 2d 920 (2009) (Thomas, J., dissenting). And "it [is] entirely discretionary with Congress to what extent it . . . vest[s] Federal judicial power in them." Ibid. (quotation omitted).
"The jurisdiction of the courts of appeals over decisions of the district courts is controlled primarily by 28 U.S.C. § 1291." 10 Moore's Federal Practice § 54.20[2], at 8. In limiting our appellate review to "final decisions" of district courts, 28 U.S.C. § 1291, Congress codified the longstanding "general rule . . . that the whole case and every matter in controversy in it must be decided in a single appeal," Microsoft, 137 S. Ct. at 1712 (quotation omitted). Section 1291 therefore "preserves the proper balance between trial and appellate courts, minimizes the harassment and delay that would result from repeated interlocutory appeals, and promotes the efficient administration of justice." Ibid.
Rule 54(b) should do the same thing. Recognizing that multi-party, multi-claim actions had become more common in federal court, Congress and the Supreme Court promulgated Rule 54(b) to allow for appeals from some final judgments—even as litigation continues in district court. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 431-33, 76 S. Ct. 895, 100 L. Ed. 1297 (1956). Still, because piecemeal appeals "undermine[] efficient judicial administration," Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 106, 130 S. Ct. 599, 175 L. Ed. 2d 458 (2009) (quotation omitted), the Supreme Court has "repeatedly" warned against attempts by plaintiffs and lower courts to "erode the finality principle and disserve its objectives," Microsoft, 137 S. Ct. at 1712; see also id. at 1714 ("These changes are to come from rulemaking, . . . not judicial decisions . . . or inventive litigation ploys.").
For example, in Microsoft v. Baker, the plaintiffs, who had been unsuccessful in procuring class certification, voluntarily "dismiss[ed] their claims with prejudice—subject . . . to the right to 'revive' those claims if the denial of class certification [wa]s reversed on appeal." 137 S. Ct. at 1715. In other words, plaintiffs wanted the benefits of finality (an appeal of right under § 1291) without any of the burdens that come with a with-prejudice dismissal (res judicata and the related preclusion doctrines). No dice, the Supreme Court said: That's not a final decision at all. Ibid. If it were, "Congress' final decision rule would end up a pretty puny one." Ibid. (quotation omitted).
Microsoft tells us that if a plaintiff dismisses his remaining claims and brings litigation to an end in the district court,  § 1291 is his only door to an appeal. And that door is only open if the dismissal truly creates a "final decision." That is the balance Congress chose to strike. We have no power to strike a different one.
The rule that voluntary dismissals without prejudice are ordinarily not appealable therefore effectuates Congress's choice. That's because the existence of a without-prejudice dismissal does not stop the plaintiff from filing the exact same claim again, undermining the one-appeal rule. See, e.g., State Treasurer of Mich., 168 F.3d at 13-14 (holding the court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because "it [wa]s possible that the claim dismissed without prejudice w[ould] be refiled," so exercising jurisdiction "would undermine the policies of judicial efficiency [and] avoiding piecemeal litigation" (quotation omitted)). With-prejudice dismissals, on the other hand, have res judicata implications and therefore prevent gamesmanship by plaintiffs and their lawyers. Cf. Ryan, 577 F.2d at 301-02. Again: If a party wants to dismiss its remaining claims and then appeal, Congress and precedent require those dismissals to be with-prejudice, and the appeal to be taken through § 1291.
The majority's decision cannot be squared with these rules. Under today's new approach to Rule 54(b), a plaintiff need not be concerned that his last remaining claim is dismissed without prejudice. Instead of appealing under § 1291, he can just secure a Rule 54(b) order from the district court, despite the absence of any pending litigation in the district court, and despite the absence of district court jurisdiction now that the litigation is finished. If the plaintiff fares well on appeal, he can re-file his voluntarily dismissed claim without any fear of claim preclusion. If the appeal fails, he can re-file the voluntarily dismissed claims anyway. Either way, the plaintiff has lost nothing from his dismissal, but the courts are burdened with piecemeal litigation and appeals. And the plaintiff gets all this without ever having to satisfy the finality requirement of § 1291. That result was impermissible in Microsoft. It's equally impermissible here.
IV.
I also worry about the "litigant-disclaimer solution." Ante, at 27 (Willett, J., concurring). As I understand it, the concurrence would allow parties to manufacture finality by "disclaim[ing] the right to reassert dismissed-without-prejudice claims." Ibid. But I cannot find anything in the Federal Rules or § 1291 that allows a party's say-so to turn a non-final decision into a final one. Rather, we must determine our judicial power in every case, irrespective of what the parties might say or do:
The parties cannot confer on a federal court jurisdiction that has not been vested in that court by the Constitution and Congress. This means that the parties cannot waive lack of subject matter jurisdiction by express consent, or by conduct, or even by estoppel. The subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts is too fundamental a concern to be left to the whims and tactical concerns of the litigants.
13 Wright & Miller § 3522 (3d ed.) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted). That's why we don't let parties stipulate away jurisdictional defects. See, e.g., Frank v. Gaos, 139 S. Ct. 1041, 1046, 203 L. Ed. 2d 404 (2019) (per curiam) (noting that, even when parties agree to settle, a court may not exercise the judicial power while questions of standing remain unresolved); Nike, 568 U.S. at 91 (explaining that a plaintiff may not overcome mootness merely by asserting that the case isn't moot); Steel Co., 523 U.S. at  95 (requiring courts to ignore the parties' jurisdictional concessions and make an independent determination as to jurisdiction). Yet the "litigant-disclaimer solution" would convert a decision over which we have no jurisdiction into one over which we do, through nothing more than an appellant's ipse dixit.
Moreover, I worry that the "litigant-disclaimer" proposal causes the problem it seeks to avoid: "vanquish[ing] the finality trap by vanquishing finality." Ante, at 26 (Willett, J., concurring). When is the deadline for a party to transmute-by-disclaimer a without-prejudice dismissal into a with-prejudice final decision? If this case is anything to go by, the answer is "never": The without-prejudice dismissal at issue here was entered in November 2016. Yet the concurrence proposes allowing the Williamses to "bindingly disclaim any right to reassert their voluntarily dismissed claims" on remand to a three-judge panel of this court—no matter that this disclaimer may arrive almost four years after the dismissal. Id. at 32.
Alternatively, if the normal rules apply and the plaintiff must disclaim and appeal within the 30-day deadline to file a notice of appeal from the dismissal, seeFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) & 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), that time came and went three years ago—without any mention of a disclaimer, see Williams v. Lockheed Martin, Corp., No. 16-31238 (5th Cir. Feb. 15, 2017) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal from the Rule 41(a) dismissal after the Williamses "concede[d] that a Rule 54 order is necessary to invoke this court's jurisdiction"). That was the time to determine the finality of the district court's decision. And the Williamses failure to hew to that 30-day deadline carries jurisdictional consequences today. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 213, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007).
* * *
We can never forget that the rule of law is the law of rules. See Antonin Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989). And few rules are more important than the ones that limit our jurisdiction and hence legitimize our exercise of it. This case gave us a chance to address the inconsistencies in our jurisdictional precedents, but instead we've made them worse. I hope that we'll come back and fix these errors. Cf. United States v. Castillo-Rivera, 853 F.3d 218, 237 (5th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (Smith, J., dissenting) (observing, of an en banc court's refusal to tackle an issue presented for en banc consideration, that "[r]efusing to take this fork in the road is the easy way, but not the right one"). Until then, I respectfully dissent.
