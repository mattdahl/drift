, dissenting in part and concurring in the judgment in part:
Regrettably, I am unable to join Judge Jones's well-crafted merits opinion, because I am not persuaded the plaintiffs have Article III standing.
The normal standing requirements of injury-in-fact, traceability, and redressability apply to claims under the Voting Rights Act ("VRA"). See, e.g., Harding v. Cty. of Dallas, 948 F.3d 302, 307 (5th Cir. 2020); OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 609-14 (5th Cir. 2017); League of United Latin Am. Citizens, Dist. 19 v. City of Boerne, 659 F.3d 421, 430-31 (5th Cir. 2011). As the majority implicitly concludes, the cognizable injury here is alleged minority vote dilution caused by at-large judicial elections for Louisiana's 32nd Judicial District Court ("JDC"). Where I part ways with the majority, however, is its conclusion that the plaintiffs have shown traceability and redressability for this injury as to the Governor of Louisiana.1 
The plaintiffs have not shown that the Governor plays any role in administering at-large judicial elections in the 32nd JDC, or judicial elections anywhere else in Louisiana. Consequently, they cannot demonstrate that any injury stemming from this election practice is "fairly traceable" to the Governor, nor that the injury will "likely be redressed" by an order against him. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992) (cleaned up).2  Other Louisiana officials do have legal duties in judicial elections—such as parish clerks of court, La. Stat. Ann. § 18:422, boards of election supervisors, id. § 18:243(B), or commissioners-in-charge, id. § 18:424(C). These are the kinds of officials typically sued in voting  cases like this one.3  The plaintiffs could have sued them but did not. They did sue the Secretary of State, who is the state's "chief election officer," id. § 18:421, and has certain election-related duties, see id. §§ 18:421(B)—(D), 18:18.4  But the plaintiffs dismissed the Secretary, with prejudice, during district court proceedings. I have no idea why the plaintiffs made these litigation choices. But their effect was to dissolve any case or controversy that is the basic premise for federal judicial action. See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342, 126 S. Ct. 1854, 164 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2006) ("Article III standing enforces the Constitution's case-or-controversy requirement." (cleaned up)).5 
Look at it this way. The district court's injunction barred the Governor and Attorney General from "administering, implementing, or conducting" the at-large judicial elections at issue, and demanded they "ensure" future elections would follow the court's remedial plan. Had the plaintiffs ultimately won, would that injunction have likely redressed their injuries? No, because neither the Governor nor the Attorney General has authority to "administer, implement, or conduct" those elections, or to "ensure" how future elections will take place. The order might as well have enjoined the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. "For all practical purposes," that is, the injunction would be "utterly meaningless." Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 426 (5th Cir. 2001) (en banc). Indeed, the majority alludes to this problem. It "takes no position" on whether, had the plaintiffs won, "standing would exist and the [district] court could have enforced its remedy without the continued presence of the Secretary of State, who is Louisiana's chief elections officer." Maj. Op at 6 n.5. But that articulates precisely the key redressability question and, without answering it, the majority lacks authority to proceed to the merits. See Singh v. RadioShack Corp., 882 F.3d 137, 151 (5th Cir. 2018) ("Standing must be decided at the threshold of every federal case—before a determination on the merits.").6 
 The majority suggests there is something "unique" about this VRA case when it comes to standing, Maj. Op. at 6 n.5, but cites no authority fleshing out that proposition. It does point to United States v. Mississippi, 380 U.S. 128, 85 S. Ct. 808, 13 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1965), but that falls short. In that case challenging discriminatory voting tests, the plaintiffs sued not only the State of Mississippi, but also "three members of the Mississippi State Board of Election Commissioners, and six county Registrars of Voters"—officials who administered the voting tests at issue. See id. at 130, 132-33. As a result, I fail to grasp how Mississippi teaches that the normal standing rules of traceability and redressability apply in a "unique" way to a VRA vote-dilution case like this one.
To be sure, Mississippi also teaches that the VRA validly abrogates state sovereign immunity as legislation enforcing the 15th Amendment. See id. at 140; see also, e.g., OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 614 (explaining "[t]he VRA . . . validly abrogated state sovereign immunity") (citing Mixon v. State of Ohio, 193 F.3d 389, 398-99 (6th Cir. 1999)). For that reason, I have no quarrel with the majority's conclusion that the Ex parte Young arguments raised by the Attorney General must fail. See Maj. Op. at 6. But that does not solve the traceability or redressability problems, because Article III standing is distinct from Young. See OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 609-14 (treating standing and Young as separate questions in VRA case). In other words, even though Young might pose no independent obstacle, the plaintiffs may still lack Article III standing because they have "sue[d] the wrong defendant." Jacobson v. Fla. Sec'y of State, 957 F.3d 1193, 1209 (11th Cir. 2020).
On this latter question, unfortunately, our precedents do not speak with one voice. On the one hand, we have treated Young separately from the traceability and redressability components of standing, most prominently in our en banc decision in Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 426-27 (5th Cir. 2001) (en banc).7  And we have done so in the VRA context: in OCA-Greater Houston, we found traceability and redressability as to the Texas Secretary of State given that official's "enforcement connection" to a challenged Texas election law. See 867 F.3d at 613-14 (quoting Okpalobi, 244 F.3d at 427). On the other hand, our decision in Allstate Insurance Co. v. Abbott, 495 F.3d 151 (5th Cir. 2007), appears to elide Young and standing. In that case, involving dormant commerce clause and First Amendment challenges to a Texas law, state officials removed to federal court and thus waived sovereign immunity. See id. at 158 n.12. The Young "fiction" was therefore irrelevant. Id. at 159. But this, we explained, made the suit really "against the state," not the officials, and rendered causation and redressability "eas[y]." Id. The "state" obviously caused the plaintiffs' injury by passing the law, and an injunction against the "state" would remedy it. Id. at 159-60. No inquiry was made as to the officials' connection to the challenged law.
 The majority alludes to Allstate, see Maj. Op. at 5, but does not squarely rely on it. That is wise, in my view, because extending Allstate to the VRA would mean that traceability and redressability would always be found regardless of which officials were sued. It is hard to believe that is the law, especially because we have recently applied traceability and redressability in VRA cases without mentioning Allstate. See, e.g., Harding, 948 F.3d at 307; OCS-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 609-14. Absent any other authority squarely on point, I would rely on the normal standing requirements and find no traceability or redressability as to the Governor.8 
In sum, given the plaintiffs' lack of Article III standing, I would vacate the injunction and remand with instructions to dismiss the plaintiffs' lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. See Hotze v. Burwell, 784 F.3d 984, 1000 (5th Cir. 2015). I therefore respectfully dissent from the portion of Part I of the majority opinion that concludes the plaintiffs have standing to sue the Governor.
