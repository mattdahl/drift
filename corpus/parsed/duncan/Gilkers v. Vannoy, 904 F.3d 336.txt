, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment:
I respectfully concur in Judge Davis's well-reasoned opinion, but only to the extent it concludes that Gilkers's purported Rule 60(b) motion does not actually attack a "defect in the integrity of [his] federal habeas proceedings," Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S. Ct. 2641, 162 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2005), and is thus subject to the limits on successive habeas petitions. Id. at 529-30; 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(1)-(3). I would stop there because that holding is enough to affirm the district court. See, e.g., United States v. Hernandes, 708 F.3d 680, 681 (5th Cir. 2013) (limiting decision to "only analyz[ing] this particular Rule 60(b) motion" under Gonzalez). I write separately to express my view that the majority holding does not foreclose a genuine Rule 60(b) motion in a case presenting a different procedural posture from this one.
This case arises from a breakdown in Louisiana's post-conviction process. As the majority recounts, for over a decade (from February 1994 to May 2007) the Louisiana Fifth Circuit evidently followed a policy of submitting pro se post-conviction applications to one judge, violating a state constitutional provision requiring appeals to be decided by "panels of at least three judges." La. Const. art. V, § 8(A), (B); see generally Severin v. Parish of Jefferson, 357 F. App'x 601, 603 (5th Cir. 2009); State v. Cordero, 2008-1717 (La. 10/3/08), 993 So.2d 203 (providing background). When this systemic flaw came to light, the Louisiana Supreme Court adopted the circuit's unanimous resolution to remand "several hundred [post-conviction] applications" for random allotment to three-judge panels, in accordance with "internal procedures designed to promote completely independent review" of the affected cases. Cordero, 993 So.2d at 204, 205; see also id. at 206 (resolution providing panels be drawn from judges "who incidentally have had no hand in the process by which this court earlier handled these multiple applicants' earlier writs in this court").
Gilkers's application was among those remanded to the circuit for "completely independent review" in 2008. Id. at 210. By that time, however, a federal district court had already denied Gilkers's habeas petition two years earlier in 2006. It had done so by "looking through" to the last state decision giving reasons for denying Gilkers's claims—namely, the state trial court. See Wilson v. Sellers, 138 S. Ct. 1188, 1192, 200 L. Ed. 2d 530 (2018) (requiring federal habeas court to "'look through' the unexplained decision to the last related state-court decision that ... provide[s] a relevant rationale" for denying claims). The federal court would not have deferred to the state circuit decision because  the first time around—i.e., when review was by an inadequate one-judge panel—that "court" gave no reasons. See Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 803, 111 S. Ct. 2590, 115 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1991). But on re-review following the 2008 remand, the three-judge panel did give reasons, albeit ones that tracked the state trial court's original decision denying Gilkers's application.
Given this procedural morass, Gilkers's Rule 60(b) motion makes some sense: he wants his 2006 federal habeas judgment re-opened because one of its predicate state decisions has since undergone "completely independent review" by a state court, Cordero, 993 So.2d at 205, and has now been replaced with a new decision. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) (permitting court to relieve a party from a final judgment because "the judgment ... is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated"). Despite that surface attractiveness, however, I agree with the majority that Gilkers's motion should be treated as a successive habeas petition.
While recognizing that "Rule 60(b) has an unquestionably valid role to play in habeas cases," Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 534, the Supreme Court has instructed lower courts to rigorously separate genuine Rule 60(b) motions from disguised successive habeas applications. As our court has explained, "[i]f ... the motion challenges 'not the substance of the federal court's resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings,' then a Rule 60(b) motion is proper." In re Coleman, 768 F.3d 367, 371 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532).1  Applying that standard, I focus (as the majority does) on two key procedural facts: (1) Gilkers's 2006 federal habeas decision did not defer to the flawed state circuit decision but instead to the state trial court decision; and (2) on re-review, the properly constituted state circuit panel did not give any new reasons casting doubt on the previous resolution of Gilkers's habeas claims. In light of that, it is plausible to conclude that Gilkers's motion does not actually attack a "defect in the integrity of [his] federal habeas proceedings," id., because the defect he identifies did not infiltrate the disposition of his federal habeas petition. See, e.g., Post v. Bradshaw, 422 F.3d 419, 424 (6th Cir. 2005) (a motion may be considered a successive habeas petition even if "the motion itself does not attack the district court's substantive analysis of [the habeas] claims, but, instead, purports to raise a defect in the integrity of the habeas proceedings"). Thus, his motion is "in substance a successive habeas petition and should be treated accordingly." Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531.2 
A different question would be presented, in my view, if a prisoner's federal habeas court actually deferred to a state decision that was subsequently vacated and replaced with a substantively different decision. A Rule 60(b) motion premised on that scenario may well qualify as an "attack[ ] ... [on] some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings" themselves, id. at 532 (emphasis added), and not merely on a flaw confined to the state proceedings. After all, deference to state court adjudication is in AEDPA's DNA: "Section 2254(d) is part of the basic structure of federal habeas jurisdiction, designed to confirm that state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions." Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011). The Supreme Court has not exhaustively defined what it meant by a "defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings"—it only identified "fraud on the federal habeas court [a]s one example of such a defect." Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 & n.5 (emphasis added). It hardly seems a stretch to conclude that the integrity of a federal proceeding would also be compromised if a federal habeas court actually deferred to state court decision that turned out to be a sham. I do not read the majority opinion as attempting to answer this different question, which in any event is not presented in Gilkers's case.
I respectfully concur.
