, concurring in the judgment in part:
I respectfully concur in the result reached by the majority, which vacates the  preliminary injunction and remands for further proceedings. For my part, I would also reverse the district court's judgment granting the preliminary injunction. I would do so solely for the reasons expressed by the motions panel in Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797, 801-06 (5th Cir. 2020). See also Marlowe v. LeBlanc, ___ F.3d ___, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14063, 2020 WL 2043425, at *2-4 (5th Cir. Apr. 27, 2020); Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1081, 1088-92 (11th Cir. 2020). I express no definitive opinion on the impact of the interim factual developments discussed in Judge Davis's concurrence. I note only that, just as our panel received updates on the spread of COVID-19 in the Wallace Pack Unit, we also received updates detailing TDCJ's evolving responses to the infection, including increased testing, infection-control measures, and inmate treatment and isolation. All these developments will be subject to adversarial testing in the permanent injunction proceedings.
