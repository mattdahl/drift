, concurring in the judgment. Respectfully, I see no reason in this case to hand off the judicial power to an executive agency. Specifically, the phrase "substantially similar[,]" as used in 30 U.S.C. § 921(c)(4), is hardly so abstruse that we need an agency to interpret it for us.
By way of background, the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. § 901 et seq., affords various benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled by pneumoconiosis, which the Act defines as "a chronic dust disease of the lung[.]" 30 U.S.C. § 902(b). The term "miner," in turn, "means any individual who works or has worked in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility in the extraction or preparation of coal." 30 U.S.C. § 902(d). Those tasks undisputedly expose miners to coal dust. The term "miner" also includes anyone "who works or has worked in coal mine construction or transportation in or around a coal mine, to the extent such individual was exposed to coal dust as a result of such employment." Id. A common feature among miners under the Act, therefore, is exposure to coal dust.
Underground mining typically exposes miners to more dust than does mining aboveground. The provision at issue here thus draws a distinction between miners who work in "underground coal mines" and those who do not. That provision reads in relevant part:
[I]f a miner was employed for fifteen years or more in one or more underground coal mines . . . and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis . . . . The Secretary shall not apply all or a portion of the requirement of this paragraph that the miner work in an underground mine where he determines that conditions of a miner's employment in a coal mine other than an underground mine were substantially similar to conditions in an underground mine.
 30 U.S.C. § 921(c)(4). Thus, if a miner works underground for at least 15 years and later develops a totally disabling lung impairment, the miner is presumed to have pneumoconiosis (which is in turn presumed to have caused the impairment). Work done aboveground, however,  counts toward the presumption's 15-year requirement only if the conditions of the miner's employment "were substantially similar to conditions in an underground mine." Id.
Here, the majority says that the phrase "substantially similar" is ambiguous as used in § 921(c)(4). Yet that phrase is one that courts, lawyers, and laypeople use every day. "Similar" means "alike in substance or essentials[.]" See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2120 (2002). Nobody contends otherwise. "Substantially," in the sense relevant here (i.e., when used to describe degree rather than solidity) means "'considerable' or 'to a large degree.'" Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 196-97, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280 (1976)); see also, e.g., The Oxford English Dictionary (online edition 2018) (defining "substantially" to mean "to a great extent or degree"). Again nobody contends otherwise. Thus, an ordinary citizen would readily understand that, for two things to be "substantially similar," they must largely share the same essential characteristics. Hence the meaning of that phrase is neither ambiguous nor vague, but straightforward and plain. And as used in § 921(c)(4) the phrase means simply that, to count toward the 15-year presumption, the conditions of a miner's work aboveground must largely share the essential characteristics of "conditions in an underground mine." 30 U.S.C. § 921(c)(4).
Nor is the essential characteristic of "conditions in an underground mine" hard to fathom for purposes of § 921(c)(4). Pneumoconiosis is "a chronic dust disease of the lung[.]" 30 U.S.C. § 902(b). The underground condition that matters, for purposes of a presumption about causation of that disease, is exposure to coal dust. Of course, every "miner" under the Act is "exposed to coal dust[.]" 30 U.S.C. § 902(d). Thus, as the agency itself correctly points out, a showing that "the miner was exposed to any coal-mine dust in non-underground coal mining" is not enough to show substantial similarity to underground conditions. 78 Fed. Reg. 59,102, 59,104 (Sept. 25, 2013) (emphasis added). Instead, the miner's exposure to coal dust must approximate that in an underground mine, where dust is relatively hard to escape because the mine is not open-air the way an aboveground mine is. Sporadic or intermittent exposure therefore is not enough; rather, to establish substantial similarity for purposes of § 921(c)(4), a  miner must show that exposure to coal dust was the rule rather than the exception during his aboveground work.
The agency's interpretation of § 921(c)(4) is no different than mine, since the agency would require an aboveground miner to show that he "was regularly exposed to coal-mine dust while working there." 20 C.F.R. § 718.305(b)(2). (One might say the two interpretations are substantially similar.) Indeed the agency's interpretation of § 921(c)(4) is both thoughtful and well-reasoned. For the narrow purpose of deciding this case, therefore, it makes little difference whether we agree with the agency's interpretation (as I do) or defer to it (as the majority does). For purposes of our constitutional separation of powers, however, it matters a great deal whether we exercise our Article III power to "'say what the law is,'" Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 218, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1995) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803)), or  instead hand over that power to an executive agency. True, in cases where the Chevron doctrine applies, the Supreme Court has told us we must hand over that power where the statute is ambiguous and the agency's interpretation is reasonable. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842-44, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). But we should not resign ourselves to that outcome before making every effort to discern for ourselves the statute's meaning. That meaning is easy enough to discern here, and so I concur only in the judgment.
