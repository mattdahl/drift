, concurring. I join the court's opinion with the following observations. The complaint here states a claim only if it plausibly alleges two things: first, that Checkr's report was misleading—which is to say, that it was not as accurate as it could have been had Checkr followed "reasonable procedures" in preparing it, see 15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b); and second, that the report's allegedly misleading character proximately caused Uber to fire Twumasi-Ankrah. Proximate causation may be hard to prove, given that Checkr accurately reported that Twumasi-Ankrah had two moving violations and a "noncompliance suspension" (whatever that might be) during the reporting period, and that he apparently does not dispute fault for one of the three accidents on his report. I also have my doubts that the report's recitation of "accidents" implied that Twumasi-Ankrah was at fault for them. And it is by no means clear that the "investigation" in which Twumasi-Ankrah says Checkr should have engaged would fall within the "reasonable procedures" required by the Act. But for now at least I agree that Twumasi-Ankrah has plausibly alleged these things—albeit barely.
