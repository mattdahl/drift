, concurring in the judgment. Although I agree with much of the majority's analysis, I respectfully part ways on a couple of points. First, I think that  our decision in Stewart v. Trierweiler, 867 F.3d 633 (6th Cir. 2017), resolves the ambiguity mentioned at page 10 of the majority opinion. Specifically, I think that Stewart makes clear that plain-error review by a state court counts as an adjudication on the merits for purposes of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d). See 867 F.3d at 638. Second, I respectfully disagree with the majority's dicta that DuBose performed deficiently when he failed to object to the jacket's admission on the ground that it had been seized in 1986 rather than 1987. According to DuBose, the prosecutor told him the jacket was seized in the 1987 search, which is consistent with the prosecutor's post-conviction testimony about what he believed at the time. Moreover, DuBose himself never said that Phillips told him that the jacket had been seized in 1986; only Phillips himself suggested as much, and we are in no position to make a credibility determination on that point. And DuBose testified that he did ask the prosecutor about the discrepancy between the March 11 search-warrant return and the March 12 lab report, and that the prosecutor said the jacket had been seized in 1987. In short, everyone assumed at trial that the jacket had been seized in 1987; DuBose did try to exclude it; and the jacket itself was not crucial to the case. DuBose's performance on this point therefore was not constitutionally deficient.
