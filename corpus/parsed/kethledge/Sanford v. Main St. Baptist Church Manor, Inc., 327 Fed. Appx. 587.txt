, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I join Parts I through III.B.2, but respectfully dissent from the Court's reversal of the district court's judgment as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim. The protected activity giving rise to that claim was first made approximately five months before the allegedly adverse employment action at issue. For this reason, among others, I do not think that mere temporal proximity is sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to the element of causation for that claim.
