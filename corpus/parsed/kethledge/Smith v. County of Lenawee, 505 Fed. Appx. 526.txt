 in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the majority on all but one issue. Specifically, I would affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity to Westgate. Unlike Dye—who I think presents  a close case, but who at least showed concern by putting Smith in a padded cell and calling Dr. Stickney—Westgate basically took no action at all during his four-hour shift on the night before Smith died. I also think he had ample time to observe Smith's condition, and that Stickney's "advice" to Dye—which was dubious to begin with—was becoming pretty stale by the end of Westgate's shift. Thus, I agree with the district court that "[a] jury could conclude that Westgate's delay in providing medical care to Smith under the circumstances could constitute deliberate indifference."
On that issue, then, I respectfully dissent. Otherwise I concur in the majority's opinion.
