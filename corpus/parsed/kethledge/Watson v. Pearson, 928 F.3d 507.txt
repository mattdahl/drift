, dissenting. I see nothing in the relevant facts or law that would have made obvious to the officers  that Watson had a privacy interest in the house. Watson had just told the officers that he neither owned nor lived there. The majority asserts that "[a]t the very least, Watson communicated that he was an overnight guest or social guest[.]" Maj. Op. at 5. But neither of those things were true once Watson left the scene. Nor does Watson identify any case that would have made clear to the officers that Watson retained some privacy interest in the property based on his vague reference to "his keys inside." I therefore respectfully dissent.
