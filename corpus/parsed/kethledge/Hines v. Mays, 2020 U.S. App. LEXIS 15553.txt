, dissenting. Respectfully, the majority opinion makes precisely the same mistake for which our court was summarily reversed in Etherton v. Rivard, 800 F.3d 737 (2015), rev'd sub nom. Woods v. Etherton, 136 S. Ct. 1149, 194 L. Ed. 2d 333 (2016) (per curiam). Specifically, the opinion "nowhere gives deference to the state courts, nowhere explains why their application of Strickland was unreasonable rather than merely (in the majority's view) incorrect, and nowhere explains why fairminded jurists could view [the petitioner's] claim only the same way the majority does. The opinion, in other words, does exactly what the Supreme Court has repeatedly told us not to do." Etherton, 800 F.3d at 756-57 (dissenting opinion).
Here, neither Hines nor the majority has remotely shown that Hines was prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to investigate Ken Jones. To begin, the evidence that Hines killed Katherine Jenkins was overwhelming. Two days before the murder, Hines boarded a bus in North Carolina with a one-way ticket to Kentucky. He had a large hunting knife sheathed beneath his shirt. His girlfriend's mother—who had bought the ticket because Hines could not afford it himself—admonished him for taking the knife on the bus, but Hines responded, "I never go anywhere naked. I always have my blade." R. 173-4, Pg. ID 4201.
Shortly after midnight on March 3, Hines checked into Room 9 of the CeBon Motel in Kingston Springs, Tennessee. Later that morning, around 9:30 a.m., the motel's manager put maid Katherine Jenkins in charge of the motel's operations and gave her a bank bag containing $100 in small bills. Three hours later, around 12:40 p.m., another maid saw a man driving Jenkins's Volvo away from the motel. The maid got into her own car and gave chase, but the Volvo sped off, heading east toward Nashville.
Around the same time, Ken Jones arrived at the CeBon Motel. Nobody was at the front desk, so Jones eventually took the key to Room 21 and left a note saying that he was using the  restroom there. (Testimony at a state post-conviction hearing revealed that Jones was there that day with Vernedith White, with whom he had been having an affair for 11 years.) When Jones walked inside Room 21, however, he found Jenkins's body wrapped in a bedspread, on the floor on the far side of the room's two beds. He ran out of the room and across the street to a restaurant, where he asked someone to call the county sheriff.
Sheriff's deputies arrived soon thereafter. They searched Room 21 and, in addition to Jenkins's body, found the bank bag—bloody and empty—along with an unfiltered cigarette burned down to a nub. Then they examined the body. Someone had pulled Jenkins's clothing up to her breasts; her underwear was cut in two pieces and scattered across the room. Her neck had superficial wounds, consistent with "some firm sharp object [held] to [her] neck," and her hands showed defensive wounds as if she had tried to "ward off injury." R. 173-5, Pg. ID 4304. But the fatal wounds were to her chest—five "deep, penetrating wounds, ranging from 2.5 inches to 6.4 inches in depth." Hines v. State, No. M2004-01610-CCA-RM-PD, 2004 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 630, 2004 WL 1567120, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 24, 2004); see also R. 173-4, Pg. ID 4168; R. 173-5, Pg. ID 4283. A final knife wound, likely inflicted after Jenkins had died, went through her vagina and penetrated her abdominal cavity. The deputies also discovered stab holes with similar widths and depths in the walls of Room 9—the room that Anthony Hines stayed in the prior night. Missing altogether from the scene was Jenkins's wallet, keys (which were attached to an "I love Volvo" keychain), and her Volvo.
Meanwhile, a group of young adults spotted the Volvo—along with Anthony Hines—on the side of the road near Gallatin, Tennessee. The car's engine had overheated—perhaps from being driven at high speeds—and the youths tried to help Hines cool it off. When that failed, Hines offered them $10 for a ride to his sister's house in Bowling Green, Kentucky. They accepted. On  the way, the youths said, Hines "seemed real nervous," his eyes wide and bright; and he "talked a lot"—saying, for example, that he had bought the Volvo from "an old lady for $300 or $400." R. 173-2, Pg. ID 3910, 3932-33; R. 173-3, Pg. ID 4022. One of the youths noticed dried blood on Hines's shoulder. During the drive, Hines carried a jacket that he kept folded.
Hines arrived in Bowling Green sometime between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. His sister too noticed blood on his shirt. Hines explained that someone had attacked him at the CeBon Motel, and that he had stabbed the attacker "in the side . . . and in the chest[.]" R. 173-2, Pg. ID 3967. But he told his brother-in-law a different story: that he had hitchhiked a ride with a stranger driving a Volvo, that the stranger had tried to rob him, and that during the ensuing struggle the stranger's Volvo had run off the road and flipped over. Afterward, Hines said, he had grabbed the Volvo's keys and escaped. He showed his brother-in-law the keychain, which said something like, "I love Volvo." The brother-in-law gave Hines a ride to Cave City, Kentucky, where Hines's grandparents lived. When Hines arrived in Cave City, he bought a grill as a gift for his sister and brother-in-law. The police found the Volvo around 4:45 p.m., precisely where Hines had abandoned it.
They also found Jenkins's wallet about 20 feet in front of the car, wrapped in a shirt. Any cash that had been in the wallet was gone.
For the next eight days, Hines hid out in the hills around Cave City. On March 11 he turned himself in to a Kentucky sheriff. Before the sheriff said anything about the murder, Hines volunteered that he had stolen the Volvo but said that he had not killed Jenkins. Later that day, Hines told deputies that he would confess to the murder if they would guarantee that he would be sentenced to death. Deputies eventually investigated Hines's campsite and found, among other items, unfiltered cigarettes—much like the one discovered in Room 21.
 The jury heard all this evidence at trial. They heard that Hines always carried a large hunting knife; that Jenkins's neck had wounds suggesting that someone had held her at knifepoint; that her chest and vagina had knife wounds consistent with holes in the wall in Hines's motel room; that on March 1 Hines could not afford a $20 bus ticket, but that on March 3—hours after Jenkins's murder—he was flush with cash and bought a grill for his sister; that Hines had stolen Jenkins's wallet, keys, and car; that Hines had blood on his shirt that afternoon; that he told his sister that he had stabbed an "attacker" at the motel; and that he volunteered to tell sheriff's deputies "all about the murder" if they guaranteed him the death penalty.
The question here is whether every "fairminded jurist" would agree that, if only Hines's counsel had investigated Ken Jones, there would have been a "reasonable probability" that the result at Hines's trial would have been different. See Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). But neither Hines nor the majority has even attempted to make that showing. Nor could they. At trial, Jones offered no testimony regarding Hines's guilt, instead testifying about his discovery of the body. Any post-investigation to impeach him on that score would have been a waste of time—which makes this case easily distinguishable from the cases cited by the majority. See Ramonez v. Berghuis, 490 F.3d 482, 489-91 (6th Cir. 2007) (investigation could have led to impeachment of the prosecution's key witness); Stewart v. Wolfenbarger, 468 F.3d 338, 361 (6th Cir. 2006) (same). And there is zero reason to think that, after investigation, counsel could have presented Jones as the "real killer" at trial. Quite the contrary: in post-conviction proceedings, Jones and White testified that they were regulars at the CeBon Motel, and that they came to the motel on March 3 to do what they had done at least "100 times"—namely, to carry on their affair, as part of their "normal Sunday routine." Hines, 2004 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 630, 2004 WL 1567120, at *27. And White testified that Jones was in Room 21 that morning  for "less than a minute"—with her watching him the whole time—before he came running out, scared and—unlike Hines—without any blood on his clothes.
In sum, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals had every reason to reject Hines's Strickland claim on the ground that it was "farfetched." See id. And we have no reason whatever to grant habeas relief on that same claim here. I respectfully dissent.
