, concurring. I agree that Cooper's notice provided the "date or dates" of the District's alleged violations. I write briefly to add the following observation. Citizen suits must "strict[ly] compl[y] with statutory conditions precedent to suit." Hallstrom v. Tillamook Cty., 493 U.S. 20, 28, 110 S. Ct. 304, 107 L. Ed. 2d 237 (1989). Before filing suit under the Clean Water Act, a plaintiff must provide notice of the alleged violation, "given in such manner" as prescribed by regulation. 33 U.S.C. ยง 1365(b). The regulation requires that the notice provide, among other things, "sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard, limitation, or order alleged to have been violated." 40 C.F.R. ยง 135.3(a). Thus the question here is whether Cooper's notice enabled the District to identify its alleged violations and thereby to choose to come into compliance with the law. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc., 484 U.S. 49, 60, 108 S. Ct. 376, 98 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1987). Cooper's notice did that: the notice informed the District that it is a "large-volume-chemical-pesticide polluter" and therefore must "publish a detailed Pesticide Discharge Management Plan"; that it "must provide information on each treatment area to which pesticides are discharged"; and that it "must take reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge in violation of [its] permit[.]" R. 13-2 at Page ID 65. The notice also makes reasonably clear that the District was not then doing any of these things. Those allegations constituted the legal basis for Cooper's suit, and thus the notice was sufficient.
