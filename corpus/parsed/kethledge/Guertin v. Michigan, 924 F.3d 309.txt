, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc. To state the obvious, the sympathies of every decent person run entirely to the plaintiffs in this case. But sometimes the law, evenhandedly applied, leads to a result contrary to the crush of popular opinion. This is one of those cases.
Respectfully, the majority's decision on the issue of qualified immunity is barely colorable. To overcome qualified immunity, the plaintiffs must show that "existing law" made not merely the legality, but "the constitutionality of the [state] officer's conduct 'beyond debate.'" District of Columbia v. Wesby, 138 S.Ct. 577, 589, 199 L. Ed. 2d 453 (2018) (emphasis added) (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (2011)). Here, the putative constitutional violation concerns the vaguest of constitutional doctrines, namely substantive due process. The doctrine purports to protect—"specifically," no less—"those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed." Maj. Op. at 6-7 (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720-21, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997)). That formulation (along with any number of alternative ones) is more oratory than legal rule, which has made the doctrine malleable enough to generate an array of constitutional rights over the years. Those include, to cite only a handful: the right to work unlimited hours in a bakery, Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 53, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905); the right to procreate, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L. Ed. 1655 (1942); the right to charge certain minimum railroad rates, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 149, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908); the right to teach schoolchildren in German, Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 403, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042  (1923); and the right not to pay "grossly excessive" punitive damages, BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 562, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809 (1996).
But just as crowbars are not made out of tin, substantive due process's easy malleability makes it a notably poor instrument for prying away an officer's qualified immunity. For to overcome that immunity in a case (like this one) where the claim is constitutional, the "contours" of the relevant constitutional rule "must be so well defined that it is 'clear to a reasonable officer'" that his conduct would violate the rule. Wesby, 138 S.Ct. at 590 (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001)). That requirement—often repeated by the Supreme Court, but sometimes, as here, overlooked—presents two obstacles to the majority's decision in this case. The first concerns the particular "fundamental right" (or rule) that the majority relies upon, namely a "right to bodily integrity[.]" Maj. Op. at 7. The sheer vagueness of that formulation illustrates that its "contours" are shapeless rather than crisp, subjective rather than objective, unknowable until judicially announced. Even the majority acknowledges (as it stretches the right further) that the right presents "far from a categorical rule." Maj. Op. at 8.
The second problem is related: the "bodily integrity" caselaw fails to provide the "high 'degree of specificity[,]'" Wesby, 138 S.Ct. at 590 (quoting Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S.Ct. 305, 309, 193 L. Ed. 2d 255 (2015) (per curiam)), necessary to overcome qualified immunity, at least as to the claim here. Instead that caselaw for the most part provides a handful of data points, which form more of a dusty nimbus than a planetary ring. But the caselaw does reveal a sine qua non for the right's violation: that the officer's invasion of the plaintiff's bodily integrity be intentional. To cite the majority's own examples: the right protects against "forcible injection" of "antipsychotic medication[,]" Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 220-21, 229, 110 S. Ct. 1028, 108 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1990); against forcible stomach-pumping, Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S. Ct. 205, 96 L. Ed. 183 (1952); and, in a district court case, against conducting medical experiments upon cancer patients without their consent, In re Cincinnati Radiation Litigation, 874 F.Supp. 796, 803 (S.D.Ohio 1995). Nobody forcibly injects or stomach-pumps or conducts medical experiments upon another person by accident. Yet the claim at issue here, as the plaintiffs themselves make it, indisputably sounds in negligence: that "Defendants violated Plaintiffs' rights to bodily integrity, insofar as Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs from a foreseeable risk of harm"—the classic formulation, as any first-year law student knows, of a negligence claim—from "exposure to lead contaminated water." Compl. ¶ 384 (emphasis added). And even the majority concedes that "[t]here is no allegation defendants intended to harm Flint residents." Maj. Op. at 18. Thus, the only manner in which the majority's "examples illustrate the breadth" of the right to bodily integrity, Maj. Op. at 9, is to show that the right is inapposite here.
What the majority opinion does, in response, is simple: it changes the level of generality at which it describes the putative right, until the description is general enough to reach the plaintiffs' allegations of negligence. Specifically, what the court first describes as a "constitutional right [of persons] to be free from forcible intrusions on their bodies against their will," Maj. Op. at 9 (emphasis added), on the next page becomes a sweeping right of "nonconsenting individuals" to be free of "foreign substances with no known therapeutic value[,]" Maj. Op. at 10—in short, a constitutional right to be free of unwanted  substances. That putative right is violated every day, indeed every time that virtually any of us takes a breath. But more to the point, the majority's formulation elides what the prior cases require—namely that the officer's injection or intrusion of the "foreign substance" into the plaintiff's body be intentional.
No official—no matter how blameworthy he might be on moral grounds—can be expected to recognize in advance that a court will recast a legal rule so that it applies to conduct to which it has never applied before. That in part is why the Supreme Court has "repeatedly stressed that courts must not 'define clearly established law at a high level of generality[.]'" Wesby, 138 S.Ct. at 590 (quoting Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765, 779, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (2014)). Yet that is precisely what our court's opinion does here. The Supreme Court has also repeatedly said that courts must not turn substantive due process into "a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States[.]" Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 332, 106 S. Ct. 662, 88 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1986) (quoting Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976)). Yet our court's opinion does that too, by expanding substantive due process to reach claims based on negligence rather than intent. Our court's opinion, "in other words, does exactly what the Supreme Court has repeatedly told us not to do." Etherton v. Rivard, 800 F.3d 737, 757 (6th Cir. 2015) (dissenting opinion), rev'd sub nom. Woods v. Etherton, 136 S.Ct. 1149, 194 L. Ed. 2d 333 (2016) (per curiam).
I respectfully dissent from the order denying rehearing en banc.
