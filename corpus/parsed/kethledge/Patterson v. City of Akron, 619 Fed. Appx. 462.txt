, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Although I agree with the majority that we should remand Derek Patterson's claims for a new trial, I think the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Brian's claims. Brian surely knew what he was doing when he released his claims. A conscientious state trial judge supervised the procedure by which Brian released them. And by agreeing to release them, Brian avoided the possibility of a felony conviction that would have forever changed his life for the worse. Indeed Brian would have been foolish not to have taken the deal. We should hold him to it.
I respectfully dissent from the remand in Brian's case.
