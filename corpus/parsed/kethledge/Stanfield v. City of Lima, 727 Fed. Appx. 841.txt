, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. For substantially the reasons stated by the majority, I agree that the officers here did not violate Stanfield's clearly established rights. But I would also hold that they did not violate Stanfield's rights at all. The officers received a report that Stanfield was driving an RV around the city while intoxicated. They approached Stanfield in an unlit vacant lot, late at night. Stanfield was in fact obviously drunk and kept putting his hand in his jeans pocket, despite the officers' repeated demands that he not do that. Finally they told him they were going to pat him down. At that point—as the cruiser's dash-cam video makes clear—Stanfield resisted the pat-down search and then forcibly resisted the officers' attempts to handcuff him. In my view that resistance continued well past the point that the majority thinks it stopped, since for another 20 seconds the video shows Stanfield rolling around on the ground and trying to keep the officers from controlling his arms. And it was only after the fourth or fifth time that the officers told Stanfield to "put your hands behind your back," that he responded, "I can't." Under these circumstances, the officers' force—a knee to the ribs and a flashlight strike on his calf—was as calibrated as it needed to be. See, e.g., Rudlaff v. Gillispie, 791 F.3d 638, 641 (6th Cir. 2015).
