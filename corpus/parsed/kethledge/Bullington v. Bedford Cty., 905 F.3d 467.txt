, concurring in the judgment. I agree with the majority's conclusion that a plaintiff may assert a constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 even if the conduct giving rise to the claim would also amount to a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. But the majority is mistaken in its assumption that, when determining whether the ADA claim precludes the ยง 1983 one, we may consider legislative history as a matter of course. See Maj. Op. at 8 ("After we examine the statute's language, we consider the statute's legislative history"). To the contrary, the Supreme Court has made clear that "[e]xtrinsic materials" like legislative history "have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislature's understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms." Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 568, 125 S. Ct. 2611, 162 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2005); see also, e.g., Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev. v. Rucker, 535 U.S. 125, 132, 122 S. Ct. 1230, 152 L. Ed. 2d 258 (2002) ("reference to legislative  history is inappropriate when the text of the statute is unambiguous"); United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 6, 117 S. Ct. 1032, 137 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1997) ("Given the straightforward statutory command, there is no reason to resort to legislative history"); Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 147-48, 114 S. Ct. 655, 126 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1994) ("we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear"). Simply stated, legislative history standing alone has zero significance in statutory construction; instead, legislative history matters only to the extent it clarifies a specific ambiguity in the statutory text. To the extent our opinion in Boler v. Earley, 865 F.3d 391 (6th Cir. 2017), suggests otherwise, Boler itself is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.
Here, nothing in the text or structure of the ADA supports preclusion of a parallel constitutional claim. That is reason enough to hold that such a claim is not precluded. The implication of the majority's foray into legislative history is that, if one of the committees in their reports, or Representative Edwards in his floor statement, had expressed some intention to the contrary, we would honor that intention and hold the constitutional claim precluded. But of course we would not do that: nothing in those reports or in Representative Edward's floor statement is law, and thus nothing in those materials can support a holding contrary to what the  statute itself supports. See generally U.S. Const. Art I, sec. 7. Hence we have no reason to sift through those materials here.
