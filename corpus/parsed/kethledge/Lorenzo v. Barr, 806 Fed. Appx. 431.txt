, dissenting. Whether we can order the government to pay fees to a prevailing party under the Equal Access to Justice Act depends, as the majority recognizes, on whether the government's position in the litigation was "justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988). Our court therefore must not award fees as a matter of course whenever the government loses in litigation in which the Act applies. Yet that seems to be what the majority has done here: the majority says that the government "essentially repeats the arguments previously rejected by the majority of this panel"; the majority rejects those arguments for essentially the same reasons it rejected them before; and so the majority orders the payment of fees. But what our court should do is determine whether the government's position could satisfy a reasonable  person, rather than whether that position could satisfy the judges who have already rejected it. In my view the government's position was plainly justified to that extent: indeed, for the reasons stated in my earlier dissent, I continue to think that the government's position was not only reasonable—but correct.
