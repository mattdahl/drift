, dissenting. Qualified immunity protects all police officers except "the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law." City & County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 135 S. Ct. 1765, 1774, 191 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2015) (citation omitted). Neither label fits Deputy Scott Panin. Hence I would reverse the district court's partial denial of immunity.
The only question on appeal is whether Panin violated Joseph Flanigan's clearly established rights when he (allegedly) hit Flanigan in the head toward the end of their encounter. Our caselaw says that a police officer may use force to subdue a suspect who actively resists arrest—e.g., one who struggles with, threatens, or disobeys an officer. See Rudlaff v. Gillispie, 791 F.3d 638, 641-42 (6th Cir. 2015). By contrast, an officer may not use force against a suspect who is compliant or has stopped resisting. See id.
Although in this appeal we must accept Flanigan's story as true, we must also view it through the eyes of a reasonable officer on the scene. See Grawey v. Drury, 567 F.3d 302, 310 (6th Cir. 2009). In Flanigan's telling, he ran away from Panin into someone's backyard, repeatedly ignoring Panin's orders to stop. After Panin had chased, tased, and maced Flanigan, Panin told him, "Don't get up. Don't resist." Yet Flanigan tried to get up. Only then did Panin hit Flanigan in the head. And only after that did Flanigan give up, follow Panin's commands, and submit to handcuffing.  A reasonable officer in this hectic situation could have viewed Flanigan as actively resisting arrest until he was restrained. Since Panin used only the force necessary to subdue Flanigan—and used no further force thereafter—he is entitled to qualified immunity. See Hagans v. Franklin Cty. Sheriff's Office, 695 F.3d 505, 509-11 (6th Cir. 2012).
In holding otherwise, the majority stresses that Panin used too much force to subdue Flanigan. Our cases are to the contrary. For example, we have granted qualified immunity to officers who struck a naked (and obviously unarmed) suspect with batons, maced him, and tased him 38 times, because they needed to use that much force to gain his compliance. See Williams v. Sandel, 433 F. App'x 353, 362-63 (6th Cir. 2011). So it is here. Tasing and macing Flanigan had proven ineffective, so Panin was justified in hitting him, and each blow was necessary to overcome Flanigan's resistance. See Jackson v. Washtenaw County, 678 F. App'x 302, 309 (6th Cir. 2017). The majority speculates that Panin could have arrested Flanigan with less force, but in Flanigan's own account, he did not give up until Panin had hit him 15 to 20 times.
The majority also draws support from three cases in which we denied qualified immunity, but in those cases officers used force far beyond what was necessary to make prone suspects produce their hands for cuffing, or hit suspects who had already surrendered. See Griffith v. Coburn, 473 F.3d 650, 658 (6th Cir. 2007); Shreve v. Jessamine Cty. Fiscal Court, 453 F.3d 681, 686-88 (6th Cir. 2006); Baker v. City of Hamilton, 471 F.3d 601, 607-09 (6th Cir. 2006). Neither was true here. As shown above, Flanigan remained defiant throughout, refused to stay on the ground, and resisted being handcuffed. Moreover, Panin used only the force necessary to overcome Flanigan's resistance. Hence Panin did not violate Flanigan's clearly established rights.
I respectfully dissent.
