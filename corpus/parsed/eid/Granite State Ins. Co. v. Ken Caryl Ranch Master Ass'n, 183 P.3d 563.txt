I join the majority opinion because I agree that under the plain language of section 10-4-110.5(1), C.R.S. (2007), Granite State's late notice resulted in a forty-five-day extension of the old policy, but not in a full-term renewal. See maj. op. at 14. I write separately to note that I would not resort to an examination of the statute's legislative history. Id. at 13-14; see City of Colo. Springs v. Powell, 156 P.3d 461, 468-69 (Colo. 2007) (Eid, J., concurring in part and specially concurring in part).
