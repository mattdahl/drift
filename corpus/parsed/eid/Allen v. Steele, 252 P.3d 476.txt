I agree with the majority that the Steeles failed to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation. Maj. op. at 20. I also agree with the majority that section 15(1)(c) of the Third Restatement of The Law Governing Lawyers addresses the scope of a claim for legal malpractice, and therefore cannot be used to expand the tort of negligent misrepresentation as it has been recognized in Colorado. Id. at 21. Significantly, because the Steeles did not raise on appeal the issue of whether they could state a legal malpractice claim, the issue is not now before us. Id. at 9. I therefore understand the majority's opinion as taking no position on the scope of section 15(1)(c) and its application to legal malpractice actions in Colorado. Accordingly, I join the opinion of the majority.
