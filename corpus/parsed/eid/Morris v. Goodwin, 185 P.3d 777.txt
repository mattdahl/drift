 in the judgment only.
I agree with the majority that section 13-21-101, C.R.S. (2007), does not allow a claimant to collect prejudgment interest on the portion of a jury verdict that exceeds the noneconomic damages cap imposed by section 13-64-302, C.R.S. (2007). See maj. op. at 10. Unlike the majority, however, I find it unnecessary to delve into the legislative  purpose behind section 13-21-101. See maj. op. at 8. Rather, I would rely on the fact that a claimant cannot collect prejudgment interest on money damages to which he or she is not legally entitled. See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Starke, 797 P.2d 14, 19 (Colo. 1990). Because Goodwin was not legally entitled to noneconomic damages in excess of section 13-64-302's cap, no prejudgment interest could be awarded on that excess. I would uphold the trial court on that basis.
