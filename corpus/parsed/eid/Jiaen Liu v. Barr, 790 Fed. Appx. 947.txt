, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the majority that Liu's petition for review should be denied, but I would do so on the alternate ground that Liu's evidence as to past persecution was not "credible." See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). The BIA concluded that Liu's testimony lacked credibility, and there is "relevant evidence [that] a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support [this] conclusion." Lax v. Astrue, 489 F.3d 1080, 1084 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting Hackett v. Barnhart, 395 F.3d 1168, 1172 (10th Cir. 2005)) (articulating the "substantial evidence" standard of review). Specifically, in at least two instances, Liu's written statements and oral testimony differed significantly regarding dates pertinent to his alleged persecution. For example, the date he provided in his application for when he went into hiding to avoid Chinese officials was almost six months later than the date he gave in his oral testimony. In addition, Liu's application differed drastically from his oral testimony regarding the timeframe of when Chinese officials confronted his mother about his whereabouts. This lack of "consistency between the applicant's . . . written and oral statements" bears on whether the applicant's testimony is credible enough for the applicant to meet his burden of proof. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Because there is substantial evidence to support the BIA's conclusion that Liu's evidence of past persecution lacked credibility, Liu has failed to establish past persecution. Furthermore, for the reasons stated by the majority, Liu has also failed to establish fear of future persecution. Accordingly, I would deny Liu's petition for review without reaching the question of whether the instances of past persecution were sufficiently egregious to warrant asylum.
