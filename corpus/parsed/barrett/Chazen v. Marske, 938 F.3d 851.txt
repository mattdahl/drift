, concurring. I join the panel's opinion because it has support in our precedent. I write separately, though, to express concern about the state of our precedent. As the opinion observes, the complexity of our cases in this area is "staggering." We have stated the "saving clause" test in so many different ways that it is hard to identify exactly what it requires. And the resulting confusion has caused our law to drift beyond the course we set in In re Davenport. See 147 F.3d 605, 611 (7th Cir. 1998). At this point, our definition of "inadequacy" and "ineffectiveness" under § 2255(e) undermines the limits that § 2255(h) imposes on second or successive motions. Our patch for statutory cases has grown larger than the hole we identified in the statute.
Davenport aims to fix a "glitch" in § 2255(h)(2). See Brown v. Caraway, 719 F.3d 583, 587 n.1 (7th Cir. 2013) (quoting Unthank v. Jett, 549 F.3d 534, 536 (7th Cir. 2008)). That provision permits a prisoner to bring a second or successive challenge to his detention if the motion is based on "a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable." This permission does not apply, however, to a second or successive motion based on a new statutory interpretation—perhaps because of a congressional oversight. As one noted treatise explains, Congress appears to have modeled § 2255(h)(2) on § 2244(b), which governs second and successive collateral attacks by state prisoners. Hart & Wechsler's The Federal Courts And The Federal System 1362 (Richard H. Fallon Jr. et al. eds., 7th ed. 2015). But "Congress seems to have lost sight of the fact that federal convicts more often can raise federal statutory claims in their collateral attacks—notably in cases in which the federal criminal statute under which a prisoner was convicted has since been authoritatively interpreted more narrowly." Id. Davenport holds that § 2255's failure to provide a federal prisoner "any opportunity for judicial rectification of so fundamental a defect in his conviction as having been imprisoned for a nonexistent offense" renders § 2255 "inadequate" or "ineffective" for purposes of § 2255(e)'s saving clause. 147 F.3d at 611. Thus, a  prisoner in that situation can seek a writ of habeas corpus under § 2241. Id.1 
Davenport's test for "inadequacy" and "ineffectiveness" largely tracks § 2255(h)(2). That makes sense. The "structural problem" in § 2255 is that § 2255(h)(2) doesn't authorize second or successive motions based on statutory claims. See Poe v. LaRiva, 834 F.3d 770, 773 (7th Cir. 2016) ("Where Davenport recognized a structural problem in § 2255(h) is in the fact that it did not permit a successive petition for new rules of statutory law made retroactive by the Supreme Court."). Davenport fixes that problem by effectively giving such prisoners the relief that they would have had if § 2255(h)(2) had included them.
Our cases, however, have phrased Davenport's test inconsistently, and little by little, they have stopped tracking § 2255(h)(2). Most significantly, we have moved away from Davenport's requirement that the change in law come from the Supreme Court. 147 F.3d at 611. Sometimes we have included that requirement in our restatement of the test. See, e.g., Light v. Caraway, 761 F.3d 809, 812 (7th Cir. 2014) (allowing for "a § 2241 challenge based on a new statutory interpretation by the Supreme Court" (emphasis added)). Sometimes we have not. See, e.g., Montana v. Cross, 829 F.3d 775, 783 (7th Cir. 2016). To be sure, almost all of our post-Davenport cases have dealt with petitions based on Supreme Court decisions, so in the mine-run of cases, nothing has turned on the source of the rule.2  Still, we stopped explicitly saying that the rule must come from the Supreme Court, and recently, we allowed a petitioner to obtain relief based on a circuit-level decision. Beason v. Marske, 926 F.3d 932, 935 (7th Cir. 2019). Under our circuit's law, therefore, a prisoner with a second or successive statutory claim can secure relief based on a court of appeals case, while a prisoner with a second or successive constitutional claim can secure relief only when the Supreme Court acts. That is an odd state of affairs.
It also raises the stakes for the choice-of-law question that we do not resolve today: which circuit's law applies to a Davenport petition. Chazen's case illustrates the point. Chazen was convicted in the Eighth Circuit, so its law governed his trial, sentencing, direct appeal, and first § 2255 motion. Even now, there is no controlling law in the Eighth Circuit on which Chazen could base a claim for relief, so a collateral attack filed there would fail.3  But a § 2241 petition is filed in the circuit of confinement, and seeking the benefit of Van Cannon v. United States, 890 F.3d 656 (7th Cir. 2018), Chazen argues that we should apply Seventh Circuit law to resolve his petition.
We should be skeptical of this argument. Applying the law of the circuit of confinement risks recreating some of the problems that § 2255 was designed to fix. See United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 210-19, 72 S. Ct. 263, 96 L. Ed. 232 (1952) (explaining that § 2255 directs post-conviction litigation to the district of conviction to avoid the practical problems that existed before § 2255, when all litigation was brought by a writ of habeas corpus in the district of confinement); see also HART & WECHSLER at 1356 (cataloguing the issues courts faced before § 2255's enactment). We have never decided the issue, but district courts confronting it have concluded that the law of the circuit of conviction applies. As one court explained:
The rule ensures that the law that prevails in the judicial circuit of any federal prisoner's conviction, or a substantially similar law, is the law that will be applied to the prisoner's § 2241 petition seeking vacation of a conviction. Application of the law of the place of conviction is a consistent, reasonable rule, as is evidenced by the requirement that § 2255 motions be filed in the district of conviction. The rule [petitioner] believes appropriate—applying the substantive law of the place of confinement—is actually far more arbitrary. Such a rule would base the choice of law decision on the fortuitous placement of a prisoner by the Bureau of Prisons, not the more rational factor of the place of conviction.
Hernandez v. Gilkey, 242 F. Supp. 2d 549, 554 (S.D. Ill. 2001); see also Cano v. Warden USP—Terre Haute, No. 2:17-cv-441, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116042, 2018 WL 3389746 (S.D. Ind. July 12, 2018); Roberts v. Watson, No. 16-cv-541, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 203930, 2017 WL 6375812 (W.D. Wis. Dec. 12, 2017); accord Burgess v. Williams, No. 4:18-cv-2643, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107969, 2019 WL 2641902 (N.D. Ohio June 27, 2019); Eames v. Jones, 793 F. Supp. 2d 747, 749 (E.D.N.C. 2011). This position has force.
Today's opinion avoids resolving the choice-of-law problem because the government conceded in the district court that Seventh Circuit law applies.4  I have reservations about whether we should accept this concession. While we have the discretion to accept a concession on a point of law, we are not obligated to do so. Krieger v. United States, 842 F.3d 490, 499 (7th Cir. 2016) ("Of course we are not bound to accept the government's concession when the point at issue is a question of law."); see also Costello v. BeavEx, Inc., 810 F.3d 1045, 1061 n.4 (7th Cir. 2016) (rejecting a party's concession on a question of law).  Here, I worry that accepting the concession risks giving the impression that we settled the issue. Lest there be any confusion, we have not. In a later case, this is an issue that deserves our careful consideration; it is not one that we should resolve for all cases based on the government's litigating position in this one.
Chazen's case implicates other issues that the full court should clarify at some point. For example, as today's opinion explains, we have articulated at least three different standards for determining whether a recently decided case qualifies as one that the petitioner could not have raised in his initial § 2255 motion. Maj. Op. at 18-19. We need to pick one. And when we do, we should focus on the fact that some of our formulations specify that the recently decided case must announce a "new rule" without explaining what this means. See, e.g., Light, 761 F.3d at 812 (asserting that a § 2241 petition must be "based on a new statutory interpretation by the Supreme Court" (emphasis added)). In particular, we have not discussed whether "newness" in the Davenport context bears any relationship to the "newness" requirements in § 2255(h)(2) and § 2255(f)(3). A "new" rule for purposes of these subsections is one that "breaks new ground" rather than clarifying established law. Headbird v. United States, 813 F.3d 1092, 1095 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 301, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1989)) (explaining that "newness" has the same meaning in both § 2255(h)(2) and § 2255(f)(3)). Other circuits have held that Mathis, which the Supreme Court characterized as dictated by Taylor, does not satisfy this test. See, e.g., Washington v. United States, 868 F.3d 64, 65-66 (2d Cir. 2017); Arazola-Galea v. United States, 876 F.3d 1257, 1259 (9th Cir. 2017); In re Conzelmann, 872 F.3d 375, 376-77 (6th Cir. 2017); United States v. Taylor, 672 F. App'x 860, 863 (10th Cir. 2016). Thus, if the Davenport test uses "new" in the standard habeas sense that it has in § 2255(h)(2) and § 2255(f)(3), Chazen's claim presumably cannot succeed. See Guenther v. Williams, No. 17-cv-231, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181619, 2017 WL 5054731 (W.D. Wis. Nov. 2, 2017) (holding that a Mathis claim is not cognizable under § 2241 because Mathis applied established law rather than announcing a "new" rule).
But as Chazen points out, we have not expressly embraced this definition of "new" for Davenport petitions—and we have sometimes implied that a "new" case is nothing more than one that opens a previously foreclosed position. If that's right, cases like Mathis, which correct misapplications of "old" rules, qualify. Maybe that is the position that we want to take, but if so, we should expressly adopt and defend it. Doing so would require us to think through the implications of forgoing a "newness" requirement in this saving clause context. For example, that position might mean that § 2255(f)'s statute of limitations renders § 2255 "inadequate and ineffective" when it blocks even a first motion relying on Mathis. But see Boatwright v. Warden Fairton FCI, 742 F. App'x 701, 704 (3d Cir. 2018) (rejecting this position).
In sum, this body of law is plagued by numerous complex issues. This might not be the case in which to untangle them, but at some point, we need to give litigants and district courts better guidance.
