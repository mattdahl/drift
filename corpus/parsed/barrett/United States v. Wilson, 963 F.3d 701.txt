, concurring. This case hinges on whether Wilson was "seized" when Officer Collins walked up to him in particular, and the measure of that is whether Wilson yielded to Collins's authority. California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S. Ct. 1547, 113 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1991) (holding that a seizure "requires either physical force ... or, where that is absent, submission to the assertion of authority"). If Wilson yielded, then he has a good argument that Collins lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him based only on his efforts to hide a bulge in his pocket in an area of suspected drug-dealing. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21-22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968). But if he immediately fled, then Illinois v. Wardlow—which approves a Terry stop of a person who runs from the police in a "high crime area"—forecloses Wilson's Fourth Amendment challenge. 528 U.S. 119, 124-25, 120 S. Ct. 673, 145 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2000); see also id. at 124 ("Headlong flight—wherever it occurs—is the consummate act of evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such."). The video plainly shows that Wilson did not pause for even a moment before fleeing from Collins. And once Wilson ran, Wardlow dictates the result. That's all we need to say; I wouldn't get into the dispatch call because it offers no support for the stop. To be sure, a dispatch call can support reasonable suspicion to stop someone who does not perfectly match the description of the suspect. United States v. Adair, 925 F.3d 931, 935-36 (7th Cir. 2019). In this case, though, Wilson wasn't a less-than-perfect match—he wasn't even in the ballpark.
