, dissenting. My colleagues have conceptualized this contract claim in a way that bears little resemblance to the claim G&S Sales Corporation actually raised and litigated below. It's not our role to situate the case  within a viable theory of recovery; that's the job of the plaintiff's lawyer. (Here, G&S is the counterclaim plaintiff.)
In the district court, G&S premised its breach-of-contract claim exclusively on the existence of an enforceable written contract—the Non-Disclosure Agreement ("NDA"). It stuck with that characterization of its claim for more than three years of litigation, through the close of discovery and at the summary-judgment phase. It wasn't until after Judge Springmann ruled on summary judgment that the NDA is an unenforceable "agreement to agree" that G&S belatedly sought to amend its complaint to add claims premised on the existence of an enforceable oral contract or, alternatively, an implied-in-fact contract, and to seek recovery under the implied-in-law contract doctrines of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment. Judge Brady reasonably rejected this major pivot as coming far too late in the case.
The majority accepts that the NDA is an unenforceable "agreement to agree" but reverses Judge Brady's order based on a new concept of the claim: that the unenforceable NDA + the parties' job-by-job negotiations + the parties' conduct = the contract. Whatever the viability of this novel theory, it's not how G&S litigated the claim in the district court. True, the parties spent a lot of time developing a record about their course of conduct after the NDA was signed, but the significance of that post-agreement conduct was limited to the dispute about the enforcement of the written contract. Notably, G&S did not argue at summary judgment that if the NDA was illusory and unenforceable, then the parties nonetheless had an enforceable oral agreement to pay commissions, or that their course of conduct independently demonstrated the existence of an implied contract, or that the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find liability under the doctrines of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.
These are separate and distinct forms of contract liability, each with its own legal elements and factual predicates. Under Indiana law "[t]here are three general types of contracts—express, implied-in-fact, and constructive." Zoeller v. E. Chi. Second Century, Inc., 904 N.E.2d 213, 220 (Ind. 2009). "Express and implied-in-fact contracts are traditional contracts," but "constructive contracts"—i.e., contracts implied in law under the doctrines of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment—"are not contracts at all." Id. 220-21.
An express contract may be either written or oral; Indiana law also recognizes the validity of contracts that are partly written and partly oral provided that the parol evidence rule does not apply and with the important caveat that a contract partly in writing and partly oral is considered "a mere oral contract." Citizens Progress Co. v. James O. Held & Co., 438 N.E.2d 1016, 1021 (Ind. Ct. App. 1982); see also Majd Pour v. Basic Am. Med., Inc., 555 N.E.2d 155, 158 (Ind. Ct. App. 1990). An implied-in-fact contract, on the other hand, rests entirely on implications arising from the parties' conduct. DiMizio v. Romo, 756 N.E.2d 1018, 1024 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (explaining that "an express contract is evidenced by spoken or written words while an implied contract is evidenced by the conduct of the parties"). In contrast, a quantum-meruit claim is available when the plaintiff confers a benefit on the defendant at the latter's express or implied request and with the expectation of payment, if the failure to require payment would be unjust. Woodruff v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs. Admin., 964 N.E.2d 784, 791 (Ind. 2012). And a claim for unjust enrichment lies when the plaintiff confers "a measurable benefit" on the defendant "under such circumstances that the defendant's retention  of the benefit without payment would be unjust." Zoeller, 904 N.E.2d at 220.
It should be clear from this brief discussion that these categories of contractual and quasi-contractual recovery are different and not interchangeable. Pleading a single claim for breach of a written contract, as G&S did, is not enough to sweep in all forms of possible contract liability that might provide a different basis for recovery if the written contract claim fails. For example, the existence of an enforceable oral agreement cannot be plausibly inferred from a complaint that pleads only a breach of a written agreement. Nor do allegations that the defendant breached a written agreement support a claim for breach of an implied-in-fact contract, which rests on inferences from conduct alone, much less a quantum-meruit or unjust-enrichment claim. G&S itself recognized this and hastily moved for leave to file an amended complaint adding these new claims after Judge Springmann ruled that the NDA is illusory and unenforceable.
My colleagues characterize this procedural step as unnecessary, invoking the aphorism that a complaint need not plead legal theories. Majority Op. at 20-21. That principle has no application here. This litigation moved well past the pleading stage, through several years of discovery and full summary-judgment briefing. G&S consistently characterized its claim as one for breach of a written contract, specifically the NDA. Our litigation system requires a plaintiff to identify all legal grounds on which recovery is sought. Rule 16(b)(3)(A) enforces this obligation through the device of a mandatory scheduling order, a required provision of which is a deadline for amendments to the pleadings. If G&S wanted to raise additional grounds for recovery beyond the written NDA—whether based on allegations of an enforceable oral contract; or a contract partly written and partly oral, which Indiana treats as an entirely oral contract; or an implied-in-fact contract based on the parties' conduct; or an entitlement to a quasi-contractual form of recovery under quantum meruit or unjust enrichment—then it had to file an amended complaint identifying these additional claims not later than the deadline established in the district court's scheduling order. It did not do so.
Judge Brady was therefore right to insist that G&S show good cause for missing the deadline, as Rule 16(b)(4) requires. See Alioto v. Town of Lisbon, 651 F.3d 715, 719 (7th Cir. 2011). And she quite reasonably concluded that G&S had not established good cause for its delay.
G&S does not challenge Judge Brady's refusal to revisit Judge Springmann's ruling that the NDA is illusory and unenforceable. That's an appropriate concession. The NDA states only that the parties will "attempt to develop an agreement" on commissions at a later point in the relationship. That's a mere "agreement to agree," and it's well established that "an 'agreement to agree' is not enforceable under Indiana law." Druco Rests., Inc. v. Steak N Shake Enters., Inc., 765 F.3d 776, 783 (7th Cir. 2014); see also Mays v. Trump Ind., Inc., 255 F.3d 351, 357 (7th Cir. 2001) (applying Indiana law); Wolvos v. Meyer, 668 N.E.2d 671, 674 (Ind. 1996) ("The law is well established that a mere agreement to agree at some future time is not enforceable.").
In sum, G&S brought a claim for breach of a written contract, litigated it through summary judgment, and tried to shift its legal basis for recovery only after that claim failed. Judge Brady properly rejected this belated effort to add new claims so late in the litigation. We should affirm.
