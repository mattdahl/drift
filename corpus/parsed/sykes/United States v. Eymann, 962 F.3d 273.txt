, concurring. I join Chief Judge Wood's opinion except for Part IIE, which concludes that DHS Special Agent Harrington and his law-enforcement team lacked probable cause to arrest Lyons. In my view, the officers had probable cause to arrest Lyons based on the following facts known to them at the time:
•Lyons piloted at least one of the cross-country, quick-turn Cessna flights from California that prompted the call and email from DHS's Air and Marine Operations Center to Agent Harrington. That flight—on the weekend of June 21, 2013—followed the same pattern as the one just a few weeks before on the weekend of May 24. During both trips, the plane landed at small, rural airports late at night, when the airports were otherwise closed, and used self-service pumps to refuel.
•Lyons's wife owned the plane.
•When Harrington frisked Lyons, he felt what he thought was a wad of cash in his pocket. When asked about it, Lyons said it was an envelope containing $1,600. But the envelope actually contained $2,600 in cash. Misstating the amount by $1,000 was suspicious.
•Lyons said the cash was for fuel and expenses, but Harrington knew that the self-service pumps at rural airports do not take cash. This added to the suspicion.
•Lyons's fainting spell: Nervousness may be common in a police encounter, but fainting is unusual, as Harrington  testified. This goes beyond the garden-variety nervousness mentioned in United States v. Williams, 731 F.3d 678, 687 (7th Cir. 2013).
These facts—and the discovery of Eymann's marijuana—add up to probable cause. I agree, however, with Chief Judge Wood's analysis and application of the inevitable-discovery doctrine. So my disagreement on the probable-cause point means only that we end up in the same place for two reasons.
