I respectfully dissent. I believe the Board acted outside its legal authority in turning this mundane disagreement over $ 78.21 in charges, that resulted from intentional third-party fraud, into a $ 2500 civil penalty proceeding.
This case involves a billing dispute between Evercom and a business (Quality Services Corp., whose president is Mr. Ken Silver). The charges were for five collect calls supposedly made to Quality Services on January 24, 2006, totaling $ 78.21. The charges occurred because an inmate at a Missouri correctional facility, where Evercom provides service, engaged in "glare fraud" in coordination with an unknown person outside the facility. This is a form of fraud that can occur when one person dials in on a trunk at the same moment that another person is dialing out on a trunk. If the timing and circumstances are right, the two callers will simultaneously seize the trunk line and talk to each other, while the charges are billed to a third number even though the third number is not even a party to the telephone call. Although Evercom has a proprietary system to prevent glare fraud, it had been inadvertently left off.
Evercom investigated Quality Services' initial dispute of the charges, and at first declined to reverse them. When the customer renewed its dispute of the charges, however, Evercom conducted a more thorough investigation. On March 22, 2006, Evercom was finally able to obtain from the correctional facility the recordings of the calls in question. These made it clear that "glare fraud" had occurred involving an inmate at the institution, and Evercom promptly reversed the charges. This occurred less than six weeks from the date the customer received its bill including the $ 78.21 charge.
In the meantime, however, Quality Services had filed an informal complaint with the Iowa Utilities Board. Board staff contacted Evercom, which advised both the customer and the Board on April 17, 2006, that it had determined the charges were due to third-party fraud and that they had been reversed. Board staff were willing to leave the matter at that, but the Office of Consumer Advocate filed a formal petition with the Board seeking a civil penalty. This ultimately resulted in the Board's decision to impose a $ 2500 penalty on Evercom pursuant to Iowa Code section 476.103 (2005) and Iowa Administrative Code rule 199-22.23.
I do not believe section 476.103, as enacted by the Iowa Legislature, allows for this outcome. The law in question is entitled, "Unauthorized change in service--civil penalty." It authorizes the Iowa Utilities Board to "adopt rules prohibiting an unauthorized change in telecommunications service." A change in service is defined to include "the addition or deletion of a telecommunications service for which a separate charge is made to a consumer account." See Iowa Code ยง 476.103(2)(a) & (3). Here there was no addition or deletion of a service; at most, there was an improper charge.
To put it simply, section 476.103 deals with the situation where a customer receives a service that he or she did not authorize or approve. The purpose of this law was to address the situation where unscrupulous telephone providers foist services on customers that they did not authorize or want, such as a change of providers, call waiting, call blocking, calling service plans, calling cards, etc. As telecommunications service became more deregulated, competitive, diversified, and fragmented, there arose a greater risk that this could occur. All of us can recall how events unfolded a few years back when choice suddenly came to a previously highly regulated, monopolistic telecommunications industry. We were bombarded in our homes with solicitations to change our telephone service, agree to new plans, and so forth. 2  Hence, the decision to enact section 476.103 in 1999.
However, that has nothing to do with what happened here. This customer did not receive a service at all. Rather, there was an innocent billing error due to third-party fraud. Billing errors are ubiquitous in our society. They occur in all lines of commerce. Usually, they are addressed and resolved by the parties. That was apparently occurring here, without the Board's involvement. As a backstop, if the parties had been unable to resolve their dispute, Iowa has a civil justice system that, in my biased opinion, generally works well. I do not believe the legislature intended to give the Iowa Utilities Board a roving commission, backed by the considerable expertise and resources of the Office of Consumer Advocate, to impose substantial penalties on one specific group of companies--telecommunications providers--for isolated, innocent billing errors. 3 
I also do not believe Iowa Administrative Code rule 199-22.23, the Board's rule implementing section 476.103, authorized the Board's action in this case. That rule defines "cramming" as "the addition or deletion of a product or service for which a separate charge is made to a telecommunication customer's account without the verified consent of the affected customer." Again, this customer did not receive a product or service. As the Board's administrative law judge stated, in a fact finding quoted by my colleagues in the majority, "It is an undisputed fact that no one from the Quality Services Corporation, including Mr. Silver, received or accepted any collect calls from the Bethany, Missouri, number shown on the Qwest bill on January 24, 2006." (Emphasis added.)
Finally, I have some trouble squaring the Board's action here with its resolution of the three cases described in Office of Consumer Advocate v. Iowa Utilities Board, 770 N.W.2d 334 (Iowa 2009). There the Board refused even to docket Office of Consumer Advocate petitions for penalty proceedings. All of those cases involved garden-variety billing disputes. However, residential consumers rather than businesses were involved, and in one of them the amount of the improper charge was much higher ($ 988.55) than the amount here. Most importantly, in my view, those cases involved situations where a service was actually provided to the customer (albeit one that the customer did not authorize), thereby more arguably bringing the cases within section 476.103 and rule 199-22.23. Nevertheless, the Board did not go forward in any of those cases, and the supreme court approved the Board's decision not to go forward, noting, "In each of the three cases at issue, the Board specifically found that there was no violation of the statute--only mistakes or miscommunications." 770 N.W.2d at 342. 4 
I acknowledge that the Board's interpretation of section 476.103 is entitled to deference. Office of Consumer Advocate, 744 N.W.2d at 643. We are bound to follow that interpretation unless it is irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable. Iowa Code ยง 17A.19(10)(l); Office of Consumer Advocate, 744 N.W.2d at 645. However, regardless of the standard of review, "the interpretation and final construction of a statute, or an agency rule interpreting a statute, is an issue for the courts to decide." Office of Consumer Advocate, 744 N.W.2d at 643. I cannot read either section 476.103 or Iowa Administrative Code rule 199-22.23 (especially the version that was in effect in 2006) and get to the same destination as my colleagues. 5 
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the district court.
