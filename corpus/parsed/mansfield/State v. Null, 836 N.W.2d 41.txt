 in part and dissenting in part).
I join in the court's opinion to the extent it affirms the defendant's convictions. I respectfully dissent as to the reversal of the defendant's sentence.
To begin with, I believe the sentencing proceeding in this case complied with Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S.    , 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012). The relevant factors relating to Null's youth were brought to light and considered. Yet even if one were to conclude the sentencing didn't comply with Miller, the remedy would be straightforward: a remand for the district court to apply Miller.
Unfortunately, the majority opinion goes well beyond that, providing pages of material. Yet at a critical point, the majority's reasoning is cursory. The majority invokes the Iowa Constitution in a brief paragraph without explaining why it is doing so and whether it intends to depart from Miller. This creates additional and unnecessary uncertainty as to the scope and meaning of the majority opinion.
In addition to the aforementioned concerns, I agree with my colleague Justice Zager that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences and therefore join part II of his dissent.
 I. Background.
Let us review the facts: Denem Null and two companions felt they had been slighted in a drug transaction. Null stole a handgun. Null and his companions then forced their way into an apartment, intending to rob the residents. The victim, an innocent bystander who was not a drug user or dealer, stood at the door. Null pointed the gun at him and demanded the "f    " marijuana. The victim told Null and his companions to leave. Null shot the victim twice in the head, killing him. Null then pointed the gun at the victim's companion, who turned her head, fearing she would be shot. At that point, however, someone in the back bedroom opened a door. Null and his companions realized there were additional persons in the apartment and decided to flee. After Null was arrested and read his rights, he stated that "he did not care that he was going to jail for life for murder."
Null was originally charged with first-degree murder. However, a plea agreement was reached. The State added a charge of first-degree robbery; Null agreed to plead guilty to that charge and to a charge of second-degree murder; the first-degree murder charge was dismissed. Under the plea agreement, whether the murder and robbery sentences would run concurrently or consecutively was left up to the court to determine at sentencing. Null understood the State was going to  argue for consecutive sentences. If the sentences were concurrent, this would mean thirty-five years imprisonment before parole eligibility; consecutive sentences would mean 52.5 years.
By the time of the sentencing hearing, Null had turned eighteen. The presentence investigation (PSI), which the district court clearly had read and which it discussed at the sentencing, recommended concurrent sentences. In explaining this recommendation, the PSI cited the defendant's age. The PSI also described Null's difficult family circumstances. Yet, in addition, it quoted Null's acknowledgment, "I had everything I needed to do right." Following verbal presentations by the victim's family, the prosecutor, and defense counsel, Null was given the opportunity to address the court. He told the court, "I ain't got nothing to say." The district court decided to make the two sentences consecutive. It gave a detailed explanation for its decision.
Our task on appeal should be straightforward. Null was sentenced before the United States Supreme Court decided Miller. Now we have the benefit of Miller. We need to determine whether Null's existing sentence comports with Miller. If it doesn't, then we need to remand the case for the district court to resentence in light of Miller. Unfortunately, the majority overlooks the first issue and overdoes the second.
Moreover, at the end of its opinion, the majority needlessly injects uncertainty into its ruling by detouring into Iowa constitutional law. Although the relevant precedent (Miller) is a federal constitutional case decided only one year ago, the majority proclaims that it is applying "the principles of Miller. . . under the Iowa Constitution." What this statement means is unclear. How do you "apply" a federal constitutional decision under the state constitution? I fear this strange statement will lead to confusion among lawyers and judges. Instead, we should be direct and clear about whether we are requiring something that Miller does not require.
 II. Null's Sentence Does Not Violate Miller.
I do not believe Null's sentence violates Miller; hence, in my view, no resentencing is necessary. I will assume for the sake of argument that Null's murder sentence and his robbery sentence should be aggregated into one sentence because they arose out of a single course of events. I will also assume for the sake of argument that a requirement to serve 52.5 years minimum before parole eligibility is a de facto life without parole (LWOP) sentence, although this is a close call. See People v. Caballero, 55 Cal. 4th 262, 145 Cal. Rptr. 3d 286, 282 P.3d 291, 295 (Cal. 2012) (finding that a 110-year sentence amounts to de facto LWOP and focusing on whether the parole eligibility date falls outside the defendant's natural life expectancy); People v. Rainer,     P.3d    ,    , 2013 COA 51, ¶37, 2013 WL 1490107, at *12-14 (Colo. Ct. App. 2013) (surveying the caselaw and finding that a sentence under which the defendant must serve fifty-six years before being eligible for parole at the age of seventy-five was a de facto LWOP sentence); Adams v. State,     So. 3d    ,    , 2012 Fla. App. LEXIS 13000, *6, 2012 WL 3193932, at *2 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2012) (concluding that a sentence of 58.5 years in prison was a de facto LWOP sentence where the defendant would not be eligible for release until he was nearly seventy-six); Floyd v. State, 87 So. 3d 45, 47 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2012) (holding that a combined eighty-year sentence was a functional LWOP sentence where the defendant would not be eligible for parole until age eighty-five, exceeding the defendant's life expectancy); Parker v. State, 119 So. 3d 987, 997, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 321, *24, 2013 WL 2436630, at *8-10 (Miss. 2013) (finding that a life sentence where the defendant would be eligible for conditional release at age sixty-five was covered by Miller while noting that conditional release "is more akin to clemency" than parole). But see Bunch v. Smith, 685 F.3d 546, 547, 552 (6th Cir. 2012) (holding that an eighty-nine-year cumulative sentence for the robbery, kidnapping, and repeated rape of one victim committed when the defendant was a juvenile did not clearly violate the prohibition on LWOP sentences of juveniles for nonhomicide offenses), cert. denied, 569 U.S. ___, 133 S. Ct. 1996, 185 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2013); Silva v. McDonald, 891 F. Supp. 2d 1116, 1131 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (finding that a sentence of forty years to life did not violate the Eighth Amendment, where the defendant was sixteen years old at the time of the crime and would be eligible for parole before he turned sixty); State v. Kasic, 228 Ariz. 228, 265 P.3d 410, 415 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011) (concluding that Graham v. Florida does not apply to consecutive term-of-years sentences for various offenses that exceed a juvenile's life expectancy); People v. Perez, 214 Cal. App. 4th 49, 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 114, 119-21 (Cal. Ct. App. 2013) (finding that Perez's sentence, which made him parole eligible at age forty-seven, allowed the possibility of "meaningful life expectancy" after prison and was therefore not de facto LWOP); People v. Lucero,     P.3d    ,    , 2013 COA 53, ¶13, 2013 WL 1459477, at *3-4 (Colo.

Lehmkuhl,     P.3d    , 2013 COA 98, 2013 WL 3584754, at *3 (Colo. App. 2013) (holding that a sentence where the defendant would be eligible for parole at age sixty-seven was not the functional equivalent of life without parole); James v. United States, 59 A.3d 1233, 1238-39 (D.C. 2013) (finding that imposition of a thirty-year mandatory minimum sentence on a juvenile defendant did not violate Miller); Walle v. State, 99 So. 3d 967, 972-73 (Fla. Ct. App. 2012) (finding that a sentence of sixty-five years for one episode of criminal conduct was not de facto LWOP, even though defendant would have to serve eighty-five percent of this amount before being eligible for parole); Thomas v. State, 78 So. 3d 644, 646 (Fla. Ct. App. 2011) ("Appellant asks this Court to apply Graham to his case and find that his concurrent fifty-year sentences are the functional equivalent of life sentences. . . . While we agree that at some point, a term-of-years sentence may become the functional equivalent of a life sentence, we do not believe that situation has occurred in the instant case."); Middleton v. State, 313 Ga. App. 193, 721 S.E.2d 111, 112-13 (Ga. Ct. App. 2011) (determining that an aggregate sentence of thirty years without parole imposed on a juvenile was not unconstitutional under the United States Supreme Court's authority), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 132 S. Ct. 867 (2013); State v. Brown, 118 So. 3d 332, 342, 2013 La. LEXIS 1075, *30, 2013 WL 1878911, at *15-16 (La. 2013) (holding that a cumulative term-of-years sentence for one criminal episode should not be treated as LWOP even though the defendant would not be eligible for parole until he was eighty-six); Angel v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 248, 704 S.E.2d 386, 401-02 (Va. 2011) (finding that consecutive life sentences were not de facto LWOP because the defendant could petition for conditional release at age sixty).
Nevertheless, the district court had discretion whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences. Concurrent sentences would have made Null eligible for parole after serving thirty-five years. Thus, the outcome of 52.5 years before parole eligibility was not mandatory. Additionally, before making the sentences  consecutive rather than concurrent, the district court did take into account Null's youth and its "distinctive attributes." Miller,     U.S. at    , 132 S. Ct. at 2464-69, 183 L. Ed. 2d at 418-23. Indeed, this was virtually all Null's attorney argued at sentencing, where he urged the court to run the sentences concurrently rather than consecutively. 10 
In other words, the court did what it was supposed to do under Miller. It took into account all the mitigating evidence relating to Null's youth, but ultimately found it was outweighed by other considerations. At sentencing, Null's attorney argued almost all of the Miller factors, including his client's chronological age, his lack of maturity, the absence of mentoring or a stable upbringing, and the circumstances of the offense including the extent of Null's participation. Any Miller factors not expressly raised by Null's counsel were clearly considered by the district court, as evidenced by its remarks at sentencing. For these reasons, I believe the sentencing here complied with Miller.
A Connecticut appellate court has reached a similar conclusion in like circumstances in State v. Riley, 140 Conn. App. 1, 58 A.3d 304 (Conn. App. Ct. 2013), certification granted in part by 308 Conn. 910, 61 A.3d 531 (2013). The trial court there had imposed an LWOP sentence pre-Miller, which the court of appeals sustained post-Miller:
[E]ven though the defendant declined to avail himself fully of the opportunity to present mitigating evidence related to his youth and upbringing, it is clear that the court was cognizant of these issues and searched the presentence investigation report for circumstances that might have militated against imposing a life without parole sentence.
Id. at 310. The Connecticut appellate court also declined to require sentencing courts to engage in express, on-the-record consideration of the incidents of youth. Id. at 315 (observing that "sentencing, of course, is not a science"); see also Conley v. State, 972 N.E.2d 864, 870, 880 (Ind. 2012) (upholding a pre-Miller LWOP sentence for a juvenile convicted of murder where the sentence was not mandatory and the sentencing court had considered the defendant's youth as a mitigating factor).
In summary, and contrary to my colleagues' suggestion, what the district court did here involved far more than "a generalized notion of taking age into consideration as a factor in sentencing." 11 
  III. Even if the Sentence Violated Miller, We Should Just Remand for Resentencing in Light of Miller.
But even if we believe the sentence did not comply with Miller, there is a simple solution: We should just remand for the district court to apply Miller. This requires only a brief opinion, such as what we say in footnote 5 of our opinion this term in State v. Ragland, 836 N.W.2d 107, 113 n.5, 2013 Iowa Sup. LEXIS 93, *12 (Iowa 2013). The district court can read Miller as well as we can.
The Wyoming Supreme Court's decision in Bear Cloud v. State, 2013 WY 18, 294 P.3d 36 (Wyo. 2013), is an excellent model for a post-Miller remand. In approximately two pages of discussion, the court there basically just quotes from Miller. Id. at 46-48. It lists seven "factors" drawn from Miller for the trial court to consider on resentencing. Id. at 47. 12  And then it tells the district court to do its job. See also Jackson v. Norris,     S.W.3d    ,    , 2013 Ark. 175, *13, 2013 WL 1773087, at *7-8 (Ark. 2013) (on remand from the United States Supreme Court, severing the unconstitutional provisions from the statute and then telling the trial court simply "to hold a sentencing hearing where Jackson may present Miller evidence for consideration"); People v. Carp, 298 Mich. App. 472, 828 N.W.2d 685, 720, 723 (Mich. Ct. App. 2012) (listing the same seven factors as in Bear Cloud and directing the district court to consider those factors at the time of sentencing); Parker, 119 So. 3d at ___, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 321 at *29, 2013 WL 2436630, at *9 (vacating the defendant's sentence and "remand[ing] for hearing where the trial court, as the sentencing authority, is required to consider the Miller factors before determining sentence" (footnotes omitted)).
The law in this case is Miller. The pages of social science and history offered by the majority do not provide additional legal standards or meaningful guidance. They are unnecessary.
If some controverted point concerning Miller comes up after resentencing, we  can address it then, based on briefing by the parties. Until then, we should let the district court do its work.
At the end of its opinion, the majority tries to move into the practical world and explain "what the district court is required to do" to comply with Miller. However, I find the explanation unenlightening, and I fear our district courts will as well. My colleagues repeatedly say that "the district court must recognize" certain propositions. What does this directive mean? If it means that our trial judges must take on a certain state of mind when sentencing juveniles, how is that to be enforced? We don't usually remand cases for judges to "recognize" things.
At one point, the majority says the district court should make findings if it is not following "the general rule" that children "cannot be held to the same standard of culpability as adults in criminal sentencing." This also strikes me as an odd statement for the court to make. A conscientious trial judge can readily accept the proposition that a juvenile like Null should not be held to the same standard of culpability as an adult. So it is unclear to me that there would ever be an occasion for such a finding. However, the standard of culpability and the sentence are two different things. Just because a juvenile is held to a lesser standard of culpability, it does not follow that a juvenile cannot receive consecutive sentences when, as here, he intentionally shoots an unarmed bystander twice in the head and kills him in the course of an armed robbery. 13 
 IV. The Majority's Decision to Apply Miller "Under" the Iowa Constitution Will Lead to Uncertainty.
Historically, when interpreting the Iowa Constitution, this court has deferred to United States Supreme Court interpretations of similarly worded provisions of the United States Constitution. See, e.g., State v. Musser, 721 N.W.2d 734, 748 n.8 (Iowa 2006) ("Musser also challenges his sentence under the Iowa Constitution's prohibition of 'cruel and unusual punishment.' Iowa Const. art. I, § 17. Because the Iowa prohibition is similar to the federal prohibition, we look to the interpretation of the federal constitution for guidance in interpreting the state provision.").
Recently, however, we have said in various contexts that we may apply-or will apply-provisions of our constitution "more stringently" than corresponding provisions of the United States Constitution. See, e.g., State v. Kooima, 833 N.W.2d 202, ___, 2013 Iowa Sup. LEXIS 78, *8 (Iowa 2013); State v. Oliver, 812 N.W.2d 636, 650 (Iowa 2012); State v. Pals, 805 N.W.2d 767, 772 (Iowa 2011); Bruegger, 773 N.W.2d at 883.
While I wholeheartedly agree we have the ultimate authority to interpret the Iowa Constitution, I have misgivings about these kinds of statements. We are all judges who seek to apply the law neutrally and fairly as we understand it. To say we apply the Iowa constitution "more stringently" is to import a value-laden terminology into our opinions. "Stringent" is not a term that helps one decide a particular case; it describes instead a mindset or outlook. It is like saying, "We are more protective of rights than the United States Supreme Court," or depending on your  perspective, "We are more willing than the United States Supreme Court to overturn the decisions of the people's elected representatives."
When our court borrows from federal precedent but ultimately departs from it, we owe an obligation to be clear about the extent and nature of our departure and the analytical framework we are following. This helps trial judges and lawyers know what is expected of them in the future. "More stringent" does not fulfill that obligation. 14 
Having said that, it is one thing to make these statements when the underlying United States Supreme Court standard is a balancing test, such as whether a criminal sentence is "grossly disproportionate" to the underlying crime. See Oliver, 812 N.W.2d at 650; Bruegger, 773 N.W.2d at 883. In that case, some lack of clarity in the federal framework may justify a lack of clarity on our part. I still believe we ought to focus on explaining our decision making, and forego the use of simplistic terminology, but I can understand the court's position.
Here, however, we do not have that excuse. Miller is not a balancing case. It involves, rather, the "confluence" of two factors-(1) a mandatory life without parole sentence that was imposed without consideration of the mitigating qualities of youth on (2) an individual who committed a crime when under the age of eighteen. See Miller,     U.S. at    , 132 S. Ct. at 2463-64, 183 L. Ed. 2d at 418. So Miller sets forth a clear federal constitutional rule that we should either follow or not follow. Regardless, we should be explicit about what we are doing.
My colleagues are not explicit. Rather, they say they are applying "the principles of Miller. . . under the Iowa Constitution." I do not know what this means. The only clue can be found in the preceding citation to Bruegger, where my colleagues include a parenthetical statement that we have applied "principles espoused in Roper in a more stringent fashion under the Iowa Constitution than had been explicitly adopted by the Supreme Court under the United States Constitution." This suggests my colleagues may be following something more than just Miller. But if so, they should say what it is, why they are taking this approach, and what in Iowa's constitution justifies it.
To my knowledge, no other state supreme court has applied Miller in this way. Other courts have simply implemented Miller and said that is what they are doing. 15 
  V. Conclusion.
In sum, I believe the sentencing hearing in this case complied with Miller. But if a new sentencing hearing is necessary, we should just order it. And while we are at it, we should be forthright as to whether we are following Miller and, if not, what additional requirements we are imposing and why.
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.
Waterman, J., joins this concurrence in part and dissent in part.
ZAGER, Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).
I concur in the majority opinion which affirmed Null's convictions and the rulings on the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. I respectfully dissent as to the reversal of the defendant's sentence.
Both the majority opinion and Justice Mansfield's opinion provide the factual background which leads us here, so I will not recite these facts again as part of this opinion. Because Null was sentenced before Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S.    , 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012), we must answer the threshold question of whether Miller applies to the term-of-years sentence imposed by the district court. Next, we need to determine whether it was an abuse of discretion by the district court in sentencing Null to consecutive sentences rather than a concurrent sentence.
 I. Miller Does Not Apply to Null's Sentence.
The majority opinion does an excellent job of tracing the evolution of the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence involving juvenile offenders. I also agree that juveniles are constitutionally different from adults for imposition of a state's harshest penalties-either the death penalty or life without parole (LWOP). As the majority properly notes, however, none of the cases in the trilogy of Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005), Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010), and Miller, 567 U.S.    , 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed 2d 407, involved sentences for lengthy terms of years that were not LWOP. Nor do these cases specifically address an aggregate term-of-years sentence. " '[I]t would be a great stretch to say that Graham meant to require legislatures and courts to treat youths and adults differently in every respect and every step of the criminal process.' " People v. Pacheco, 2013 IL App (4th) 110409, 372 Ill. Dec. 406, 991 N.E.2d 896, 906, 2013 WL 3193670, at *10 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013). Further, while the majority concludes that the Miller principles are fully applicable to a lengthy term-of-years sentence (functional equivalent or de facto LWOP), I am not prepared to reach the same conclusion.
I acknowledge that there is a split of authority on whether Miller or Graham should be applicable to a term-of-years sentence. Numerous courts have held that a term-of-years sentence, however long, does not fall within the principles of Graham and Miller. 16  Other courts have  found that Graham prohibits any term-of-years sentence that prevents the defendant from receiving a meaningful opportunity to obtain release. 17  Based upon this split of authority, and the underlying reasoning not to extend the principles of Graham and Miller to term-of-years sentences for juveniles, I would conclude that no resentencing is necessary here.
An expansion of the Graham and Miller requirements to cases involving term-of-years sentences similar to Null's would also lead to uncertainty and confusion.
As the Sixth Circuit notes in Bunch v. Smith:
"At what number of years would the Eighth Amendment become implicated in the sentencing of a juvenile: twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, some lesser or greater number? Would gain time be taken into account? Could the number vary from offender to offender based on race, gender, socioeconomic class or other criteria? Does the number of crimes matter? There is language in the Graham majority opinion that suggests that no matter the number of offenses or victims or type of crime, a juvenile may not receive a sentence that will cause him to spend his entire life incarcerated without  a chance for rehabilitation, in which case it would make no logical difference whether the sentence is " 'life' " or 107 years. Without any tools to work with, however, we can only apply Graham as it is written."
685 F.3d at 546, 552 (6th Cir. 2012) (footnote omitted) (quoting Henry v. State, 82 So. 3d 1084, 1089 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.), review granted, 107 So. 3d 405 (Fla. 2012)), cert. denied, 569 U.S.    , 133 S. Ct. 1996, 185 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2013).
The majority also notes that after Miller, the Supreme Court in several cases involving aggregate crimes, granted certiorari, vacated the sentence, and remanded the cases for reconsideration in light of Miller. However, each of the cases cited by the majority requiring remand included the predicate LWOP sentence in a homicide context which is distinguishable from the term-of-years sentence imposed in Null. See Blackwell v. California, 578 U.S. ___, ___, 133 S. Ct. 837, 184 L. Ed. 2d 646, 646 (2013) (granting, vacating, and remanding People v. Blackwell, 202 Cal. App. 4th 144, 134 Cal. Rptr. 3d 608, 618 (Ct. App. 2011) (life-without-parole sentence for first-degree murder, burglary of an inhabited dwelling, and attempted robbery of an inhabited dwelling)); Mauricio v. California, 568 U.S.    ,    , 133 S. Ct. 524, 524, 184 L. Ed. 2d 335, 335 (2012) (granting, vacating, and remanding People v. Mauricio, No. B224505, 2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 9073, 2011 WL 5995976, at *9 (Cal. Ct. App. Nov. 28, 2011) (unpublished opinion) (three life-without-parole sentences for juvenile convicted of three counts of first-degree murder)); Bear Cloud v. Wyoming, 568 U.S.    ,    , 133 S. Ct. 183, 183-84, 184 L. Ed. 2d 5, 5 (2012) (granting, vacating, and remanding Bear Cloud v. State, 2012 WY 16, 275 P.3d 377, 402 (Wyo. 2012) (life-without-parole sentence for juvenile convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, and aggravated burglary)); Whiteside v. Arkansas, 567 U.S.    ,    , 133 S. Ct. 65, 66, 183 L. Ed. 2d 708, 708 (2012) (granting, vacating, and remanding Whiteside v. State, 2011 Ark. 371, 383 S.W.3d 859, 865-66 (Ark. 2011) (life-without-parole sentence for juvenile for capital murder and thirty-five years for aggravated robbery)). Rather than suggesting that these cases were remanded by the Supreme Court based on an aggregation of sentences, it is my opinion that the cases were summarily remanded for precisely what Miller requires: no imposition of LWOP without an individualized assessment of the juvenile utilizing the Miller factors.
Clearly there is no overall consensus that Graham or Miller should apply to cases involving a de facto or functional equivalent of LWOP. The United States Supreme Court has had the opportunity to review cases that would allow it to expand the reasoning in Graham and Miller to cases of de facto life sentences very similar to the one given to Null, and it has declined to do so. See, e.g., Bunch, 685 F.3d at 552 (stating that since the defendant was not sentenced specifically to "life without parole," there is no violation under Graham, and if "the [United States] Supreme Court has more in mind, it will have to say what it is"), cert. denied, 569 U.S.    , 133 S. Ct. 1996, 185 L. Ed. 2d 865. In the absence of further direction and guidance from the United States Supreme Court, I would not expand the requirements of Graham and Miller to juvenile sentences for a term of years. Therefore, I would affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
 II. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Making Null's Sentences Consecutive.
Null argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences. The majority does not  reach the question, but does recognize that the question of whether a defendant's sentences will run concurrently or consecutively ordinarily "rests within the sound discretion of the district court." As we have previously observed,
the decision of the district court to impose a particular sentence within the statutory limits is cloaked with a strong presumption in its favor, and will only be overturned for an abuse of discretion or the consideration of inappropriate matters.
State v. Formaro, 638 N.W.2d 720, 724 (Iowa 2002). Further, we will only find an abuse of discretion if "we are able to discern that the decision was exercised on grounds or for reasons that were clearly untenable or unreasonable." Id.
In order to comply with its statutory duty, the district court is required to determine a sentence based on what "is authorized by law for the offense," and which sentence will, "in the discretion of the court, . . . provide maximum opportunity for the rehabilitation of the defendant, and for the protection of the community from further offenses by the defendant and others." Iowa Code § 901.5 (2009).
We have provided guidance to district court judges in applying their discretion, stating that judges should
"[w]eigh and consider all pertinent matters in determining proper sentence, including the nature of the offense, the attending circumstances, defendant's age, character and propensities and chances of his reform. The courts owe a duty to the public as much as to defendant in determining a proper sentence. The punishment should fit both the crime and the individual."
State v. Leckington, 713 N.W.2d 208, 216 (Iowa 2006) (quoting State v. August, 589 N.W.2d 740, 744 (Iowa 1999)). We have consistently stated that "[a] statement may be sufficient, even if terse and succinct, so long as the brevity of the court's statement does not prevent review of the exercise of the trial court's sentencing discretion." State v. Hennings, 791 N.W.2d 828, 838 (Iowa 2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In pronouncing sentence here, the district court emphasized that Null had received "significant juvenile court intervention . . . that date[d] back to . . . at least early 2005 according to the presentence report." The court noted Null's resistance to offered interventions and stated, "I can't lose sight also that Mr. Null went to this apartment with a loaded gun and the victim was shot in the head." The court concluded: "[B]ased on all the information before me, I feel that consecutive sentences are appropriate in this case." The court articulated the reasons for the conclusion as follows:
In determining the sentence as I have summarized here in open court, I have considered the entirety of the presentence report including the recommendation that was made by the report writer. I did consider that and determined that I was not going to follow that recommendation.
I consider the nature and circumstances of the offenses, consider the history and characteristics of the Defendant including his age and prior interventions that I have mentioned. I have considered the recommendation of both counsel in this case. I find the sentence that I have imposed offers the Defendant the maximum opportunity for rehabilitation, balanced against the interests of the community, not only protecting the community but also in receiving justice for what can only be described as a tragedy for all.
 I conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Null to consecutive sentences for his very serious crimes.
 III. Conclusion.
For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
