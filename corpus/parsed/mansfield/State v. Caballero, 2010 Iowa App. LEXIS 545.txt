MANSFIELD, J. (concurring specially)
I believe there is substantial evidence to support the district court's finding that the knife in question met the criteria for a dangerous weapon under the first statutory alternative, that is, the knife was "designed primarily for use in inflicting death or injury upon a human being" and "capable of inflicting death upon a human being when used in the manner for which it was designed." See Iowa Code § 702.7 (2007). In my view, the district court could make this finding based on its own inspection of the knife. As the court put it, "The knife is not one that has other uses or purposes such as a Swiss Army knife or even a fish fillet knife or a regular hunting knife that have other purposes other than inflicting harm." On this basis, I would affirm.
