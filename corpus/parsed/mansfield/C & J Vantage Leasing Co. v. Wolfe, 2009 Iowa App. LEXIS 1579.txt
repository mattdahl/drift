I agree that the district court should be affirmed, but disagree somewhat as to the grounds for affirmance. In my view, a "hell or high water" clause does not automatically preclude a lessee from raising fraud in the inducement or a statutory defense based on Iowa Code chapter 535. It also may not preclude a mutual mistake defense, depending on the circumstances.
My understanding of the purpose of a "hell or high water" clause is that it overrides the normal common law presumption that contractual promises are dependent rather than independent. That presumption is of ancient lineage and dates back to Kingston v. Preston, 99 Eng. Rep. 437 (King's Bench, 1773). When the lessee agrees to pay come "hell or high water," he or she is obligated to pay regardless of whether he or she receives any of the performance promised in return. The promise to pay is thus said to be "independent." I do not believe, however, that the "hell or high water" clause necessarily prevents a party from raising defenses to contract formation, such as fraud in the inducement and (perhaps) mutual mistake, or statutory defenses such as might be available under chapter 535. See Colorado Interstate Corp. v. CIT Group/Equip. Fin., Inc., 993 F.2d 743, 749 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding "hell or high water" clause enforceable "[i]n the absence of fraud or deceit"); Uniform Commercial Code ยง 2A-407, cmt. 5 (suggesting that a lessee could have a claim against the lessor, notwithstanding the "hell or high water" clause, based on "the law with respect to fraud, duress, or the like").
However, Wolfe bears the burden of establishing a genuine issue of material fact on these defenses, and as to each of them I would hold he failed to meet that burden.
The evidence here is that Lake MacBride was told in July 2003 that Royal Links would make the lease payments so that the cart would not cost Lake MacBride anything. In fact, for over a year, the cart did not cost Lake MacBride anything. However, in October 2004, some fifteen months after the parties entered into their original transaction, Royal Links stopped making the payments. I do not believe this is enough to raise a triable inference of fraud in the inducement. To be fraudulent, a promise to perform a future act must be made with the present intent not to perform. Nonperformance alone does not prove an intention not to perform. Otherwise, every breach of contract would call for a fraud remedy. See Magnusson Agency v. Pub. Entity Nat'l Co.-Midwest, 560 N.W.2d 20, 28 (Iowa 1997); Robinson v. Perpetual Servs. Corp., 412 N.W.2d 562, 565 (Iowa 1987); Irons v. Cmty. State Bank, 461 N.W.2d 849, 854 (Iowa Ct. App. 1990). Evidence that Royal Links stopped paying in October 2004 is not enough to establish that the July 2003 promises were fraudulent. Summary judgment was properly granted here. Likewise, the evidence does not establish a mutual mistake. The fact that a contract is not ultimately performed does not mean that it was the product of a mutual mistake. Also, even if there were a mutual mistake, one could conclude that the "hell or high water" clause assigns the risk of mistake to the lessee. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 154(a), at 402 (1981).
I also believe that the asserted statutory defense based on Iowa Code section 535.2 is invalid. Wolfe complains that the leasing agreement did not disclose an interest rate as allegedly required by section 535.2, even though the effective rate of interest was in excess of 15.25 percent. However, apart from any other potential flaws, this argument cannot succeed because section 535.2 is not a "disclosure" law. It requires the parties to memorialize their agreement in writing, if they are entering into a business loan with a rate of interest above five percent, see Iowa Code ยง 535.2(2)(a)(5), but it does not require a specific form of disclosure (as does the federal Truth in Lending Act, for example). Thus, it is sufficient that the due dates and amounts of the lease payments were spelled out in writing, and that Wolfe agreed to them. To comply with section 535.2(2)(a)(5) the agreement did not have to specify the actual interest rate derived from that payment schedule, even if one were to assume that section 535.2 applies to this transaction.
Except as stated here, I join in the balance of my colleagues' opinion.
