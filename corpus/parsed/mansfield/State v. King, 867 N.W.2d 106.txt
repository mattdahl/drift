 specially).
I join the court's opinion. While I would also sustain the search for the reasons set forth in my dissent in State v. Baldon, 829 N.W.2d 785, 835-47 (Iowa 2013) (Mansfield, J., dissenting), I realize the court has taken a different view. I concur in the court's well-reasoned analysis and application of the special-needs doctrine.
Waterman, J., joins this special concurrence.
