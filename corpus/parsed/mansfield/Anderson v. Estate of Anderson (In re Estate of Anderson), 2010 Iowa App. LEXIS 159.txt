I respectfully dissent. In my view, the district court did not properly apply the law of liquidated damages or the law of mitigation in this case. My colleagues adjust the district court's damages award without taking these factors into account, and therefore reach an incorrect result.
Iowa now follows the modern approach favorable to liquidated damage clauses. Rohlin Constr. Co. v. Hinton, 476 N.W.2d 78, 79-80 (Iowa 1991); see also Midwest Oilseeds, Inc. v. Limagrain Genetics Corp., 387 F.3d 705, 715-16 (8th Cir. 2004).
Here Paul Anderson entered into a farm lease with the decedent where he agreed to pay $ 45,310 per year. The lease provided that if the tenant failed to give up possession at the end of the lease term, he would pay liquidated damages to the landlord of $ 150 per day. This liquidated damage provision seems on its face to be reasonable. One hundred fifty dollars per day times 365 days would equal $ 54,750. Thus, the clause charges Paul only slightly more, on a pro rata basis, than the previous rent was. Moreover, our own legislature has recognized the time sensitivity of farm leases. See Iowa Code § 562.5 (2005) (mandating March 1 termination date). When a tenant holds over into the spring, the potential arises that the economic value of the farmland will be lost for the year, because no crop will be planted. For these reasons alone, I would enforce the clause as written.
Furthermore, the evidence at the hearing provided further support for enforcement of the liquidated damage clause. According to testimony from a realtor, cited by my colleagues, the estate lost $ 25 per acre in rent, or $ 9850, because of Paul's holdover. The $ 9850 in actual damages is not far from the $ 13,800 produced by mathematical application of the clause. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356(1) at 157 (1979) (liquidated amount may be reasonable in light of anticipated or actual loss (emphasis assed)).
Thus, I have no difficulty whatsoever in holding that Paul should have been ordered to pay at least $ 13,800 (or $ 150 times 92 days), since he held over on the entire property until at least June 1, 2008. I would agree with my colleagues that if this action is being pursued on behalf of the beneficiaries, rather than the executor, the $ 13,800 should be reduced to account for Paul's 9.85% interest in the farmland. While we sometimes rob Peter to pay Paul, there is no reason to require Paul to pay himself. Accordingly, it seems to me a minimum award of $ 12,440 ($ 13,800 times .9015) would have been appropriate.
The district court, however, awarded only $ 4000 in liquidated damages and $ 4000 in actual damages. This outcome cannot be supported in my view. With liquidated damages you are either in or out. If the clause was a penalty, it should have been invalidated and the court should have determined actual damages instead. If the clause was not a penalty, as I believe, its terms should have been followed. One cannot simply rewrite the parties' contract to award a "fair" amount of liquidated damages. 5 
From reading the district court's opinion, it also appears to have concluded that the beneficiaries failed to mitigate damages because they did not "immediately take legal action to remove Paul after the expiration of the lease." This also appears to me to have been an error. Paul had an affirmative duty to vacate when his lease expired. The duty to mitigate generally does not include a duty to bring a lawsuit to evict a holdover tenant who remains in possession. See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Cramer, 6 F.3d 1102, 1108-09 (5th Cir. 1993); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant §§ 14.5, at 30, 14.7, at 43(1977).
In any event, once a liquidated damages clause is determined to be valid, the damages thereunder may not be reduced based on failure to mitigate. Fed. Realty Ltd. P'ship v. Choices Women's Med. Ctr., Inc., 289 A.D.2d 439, 735 N.Y.S.2d 159, 161-62 (2001); 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages § 538 at 473-74 (2003).
It follows naturally that once a court has determined that a liquidated damages clause is valid, it need not make further inquiries as to actual damages. This includes a determination of whether the parties attempted to mitigate damages resulting from the breach . . . . [T]here exists no duty to mitigate damages where a valid liquidated damages clause exists.
Barrie Sch. v. Patch, 401 Md. 497, 933 A.2d 382, 392 (Md. 2007); see also Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284, 1291 (7th Cir. 1985). Mitigation arguments may be considered in determining whether the clause is a penalty, but not to reduce the damages once the clause is found to be enforceable.
The beneficiaries make most of these points in their appellees' brief. I find their arguments generally persuasive. However, since they did not cross-appeal, I think they are stuck with the district court's award of $ 8000. Nonetheless, I would not reduce those damages as my colleagues have done. Instead, I would affirm on the ground that the record amply justifies the damages that were awarded.
