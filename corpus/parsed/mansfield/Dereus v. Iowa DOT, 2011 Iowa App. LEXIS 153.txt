Concur




MANSFIELD, J., (concurs specially)
I specially concur. As I have explained in the companion case of Morales v. Dep't of Transp., No. 0-324, 2011 Iowa App. LEXIS 143, I believe Iowa Code section 321J.8(1) is mandatory, but I would deny relief where the failure to comply with the statute could not have resulted in prejudice. This approach is consistent with precedent and with how our legal system normally operates. Generally, we do not deliver windfalls to parties who claim some law was violated but who could not have been adversely affected by that violation.
The facts of this case are different from Morales, thereby in my view compelling a different result. Here Dereus was not advised of any potential consequences to his commercial driver's license, as required by section 321J.8(1)(c)(2). Thus, as noted by the district court, it is possible Dereus could have believed there would be no impact on his CDL if he refused the test. Or Dereus could have thought that if he refused the test, the consequences for his CDL would be less serious than if he took the chemical test and failed it.
Since Dereus was potentially prejudiced by the officer's failure to read part of the implied consent advisory, I agree that the judgment below should be affirmed.
