I respectfully dissent. While the defendant should have been advised of the thirty-five percent surcharge provided by Iowa Code section 911.1 (2015), I would affirm the convictions based on substantial compliance with Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.8(2)(b).
Rule 2.8(2)(b)(2) requires the defendant to be advised of the "mandatory minimum punishment" and the "maximum possible punishment" for the offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty. Here the defendant pled guilty to a class "D" felony, two aggravated misdemeanors, and a serious misdemeanor. He was advised that potential fines on all charges could total as much as $21,635, including surcharges. He was also told there would be a minimum fine of $1250 on the serious misdemeanor charge of operating when intoxicated first offense. As it turned out, the defendant received only the $1250 OWI fine, plus $210 in surcharges and a thirty-five percent surcharge of $437.50. The defendant also received a term of imprisonment totaling nine years.
It is well settled that we do not reverse a guilty plea when there has been substantial compliance with rule 2.8(2)(b). See, e.g., State v. Kirchoff, 452 N.W.2d 801, 804 (Iowa 1990). "[I]nsubstantial errors should not entitle a defendant to relief." State v. Finney, 834 N.W.2d 46, 62 (Iowa 2013). Substantial compliance "means the statute or rule 'has been followed sufficiently so as to carry out the intent for which it was adopted.'" Bontrager Auto Serv., Inc. v. Iowa City Bd. of Adjustment, 748 N.W.2d 483, 488 (Iowa 2008) (quoting Brown v. John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works, 423 N.W.2d 193, 194 (Iowa 1988)). It "means 'compliance in respect to essential matters necessary to assure the reasonable objectives of the statute.'" Robinson v. State, 687 N.W.2d 591, 595 (Iowa 2004) (quoting Superior/Ideal, Inc. v. Bd. of Review, 419 N.W.2d 405, 407 (Iowa 1988)).
The essential objective of rule 2.8(2)(b)(2) is to convey to the defendant the potential adverse consequences from pleading guilty. While I agree that a surcharge  and a fine are effectively too sides of the same coin, see State v. Fisher, 877 N.W.2d 676, 685-86 (Iowa 2016), I believe a colloquy substantially complies with the rule when a defendant sentenced to prison receives an overall fine (including surcharges) that falls within the disclosed range. Here, that plainly occurred. Weitzel was sentenced to nine years in prison and received a combined fine and surcharge that was less than a tenth of the maximum he was told he could receive.
Notably, there is no requirement in Iowa that the defendant be advised of his obligation to pay restitution upon pleading guilty. State v. Brady, 442 N.W.2d 57, 59 (Iowa 1989). Here, for example, the Crime Victim Compensation Program filed for $3620.74 in reimbursement from the defendant. That possibility wasn't mentioned at all during the guilty plea colloquy. While this restitution is not punishment, the fact that it need not be mentioned at all during the colloquy should make us hesitant to split hairs over the disclosure of fines so long as the end result was still a fine within the disclosed range.
In the federal courts, a guilty plea will not be set aside due to a harmless error. "A variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights." See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h). Whether a plea error affects "substantial rights" is analogous to whether there has been "substantial compliance" with the plea rule; ergo, federal precedents should be persuasive. Indeed, the Advisory Committee Note to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(h) makes this similarity of standards clear. In effect, for an error to be harmless under the federal rule, it must be one that of necessity could not have prejudiced the defendant, thereby avoiding any need to consider the defendant's state of mind. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h) advisory committee's note to 1983 amendments. The Advisory Committee Note explains,
[I]t is fair to say that the kinds of Rule 11 violations which might be found to constitute harmless error upon direct appeal are fairly limited, as in such instances the matter "must be resolved solely on the basis of the Rule 11 transcript" and the other portions (e.g., sentencing hearing) of the limited record made in such cases. Illustrative are: . . . where the judge's compliance with subdivision (c)(2) was erroneous in part in that the judge understated the maximum penalty somewhat, but the penalty actually imposed did not exceed that indicated in the warnings . . . .

Accordingly, federal appellate courts have uniformly declined to set aside guilty pleas in circumstances like this. See, e.g., United States v. Molzen, 382 F.3d 805, 807 (8th Cir. 2004) ("Although Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c) requires the district court to explain a defendant's liability for both fines and restitution, we hold that failure to do so does not impact a defendant's substantial rights where he was warned of a potential fine larger than the actual amount of restitution ordered." (quoting United States v. Morris, 286 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir. 2002)); United States v. Powell, 354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir. 2003) (holding that the amount of mandatory restitution should have been disclosed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, but the error was harmless where the total of fines and restitution did not exceed the total dollar amount used by the court in notifying the defendant of the consequences of the plea); United States v. Hodge, 259 F.3d 549, 553 (6th Cir. 2001) ("In this case, Hodge was informed by the district court that he could be subject to a fine of $250,000; this amount is clearly in excess of the $14,369 restitution order and $100 fine actually imposed on the defendant.  Any error committed by the district court was, therefore, harmless and does not merit a vacation of Hodge's guilty plea."). In United States v. Miell, 711 F. Supp. 2d 967 (N.D. Iowa 2010), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa thoroughly surveyed this federal caselaw before concluding,
Because the court does not intend to, and will not, impose liability on defendant Miell for fines and restitution greater than the $5,000,000 the court informed him could be imposed as a fine, the court's failure to inform Miell about the court's authority to order restitution does not affect his substantial rights. Accordingly, it does not constitute a fair and just reason to withdraw his guilty pleas in this case.
Id. at 982.
I agree with the majority that we should not engage in a "line-drawing game," but as the majority points out, the occasions where a defendant can challenge a guilty plea or appeal based on failure to disclose surcharges should be rare. The district court basically would have to commit two errors at once—(1) fail to properly inform the defendant of the necessity of filing a motion in arrest of judgment to challenge the guilty plea and (2) fail to properly disclose the surcharges. In those uncommon situations, I prefer a common-sense approach supported by precedent.
Waterman, J., joins this dissent.
