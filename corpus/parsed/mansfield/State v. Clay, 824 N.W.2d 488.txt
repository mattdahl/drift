 specially).
I agree that Clay's convictions should be affirmed and that his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims should be preserved. However, I specially concur to express two concerns with the majority opinion. One relates to the interplay between ethical rules and ineffective assistance of counsel; the other to whether the prejudicial effect of separate errors by counsel can be accumulated for ineffective-assistance purposes.
In State v. Vance, this court seemingly linked the test for whether an attorney has provided ineffective assistance, thereby allowing the court to forgive a failure to preserve error, to the ethical standard for competence set forth in the Iowa Rules of Professional Conduct. 790 N.W.2d 775, 785-86 (Iowa 2010). The court quoted rule 32:1.1  as well as an official comment and a commentary on that rule before stating, "We will use these principles to determine if Vance's trial counsel failed to perform an essential duty." Id. at 786. The court then embarked on a lengthy but ultimately inconclusive discussion of whether it would be ineffective assistance for counsel to fail to advance an argument under the Iowa Constitution that was foreclosed by a binding precedent of this court. Id. at 789-90.
In the present opinion, my colleagues reiterate some of the court's language from Vance.
I think a fair assessment of our recent precedents is that they recognize a rather broad concept of what constitutes a failure to perform an essential duty for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel purposes. See, e.g., Ennenga v. State, 812 N.W.2d 696, 702 n.5 (Iowa 2012); Everett v. State, 789 N.W.2d 151, 159 (Iowa 2010). It seems to me unwise and unfair, therefore, to suggest that a criminal defense attorney who "fails to perform an essential duty" under one of our precedents has committed a violation of rule 32:1:1.
My second area of concern has to do with the majority's imposition of a requirement that cumulative prejudice be considered. The majority says, "We adopted this rule in Schrier v. State, 347 N.W.2d 657, 668 (Iowa 1984)." I think this is an overstatement. Schrier did raise multiple claims of ineffective assistance, which we analyzed one by one. Id. at 660-67. We then said at the end of our opinion:
We have considered all issues and claims presented on appeal and can find no basis for reversing the judgment of the postconviction court denying relief to petitioner. In making this determination, we have reviewed the effect of the various claims both individually and cumulatively and find that it has not been established that petitioner was denied a fair trial. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
Id. at 667-68. Respectfully, I believe it reads far too much into the brief statement—"we have reviewed the effect of the various claims individually and cumulatively"—to conclude it announces a "rule" that such claims should be analyzed cumulatively. There is no indication the issue was even raised in Schrier. 3 
Although my colleagues appear to be following the majority rule, the question has divided other courts. See Evans v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 699 F.3d 1249, 1269 (11th Cir. 2012) (stating that the prejudice inquiry "should be a cumulative one"); Hooks v. Workman, 689 F.3d 1148, 1188 (10th Cir. 2012) (applying a cumulative prejudice approach); Moore v. Sec'y Pa. Dep't of Corr., 457 F. App'x 170, 181 (3d Cir. 2012) ("Under Strickland's clear mandate, the prejudice of these errors is assessed cumulatively."); Dugas v. Coplan, 428 F.3d 317, 335 (1st Cir. 2005) (stating that Strickland "clearly allows the court to consider the cumulative effect of counsel's errors in determining whether a defendant was prejudiced" (quoting Kubat v. Thieret, 867 F.2d 351, 370 (7th Cir. 1989))); Gersten v. Senkowski, 426 F.3d 588, 611 (2d Cir. 2005) ("In evaluating prejudice, we look to the cumulative effect of all of counsel's unprofessional errors."); Mackey v. Russell, 148 F. App'x 355, 365 (6th Cir. 2005)  ("[T]he Strickland test requires that prejudice be evaluated in light of the cumulative effect of all constitutionally infirm actions by counsel."); Pizzuto v. Arave, 385 F.3d 1247, 1260 (9th Cir. 2004) ("[I]ndividual deficiencies in representation which may not by themselves meet the Strickland standard may, when considered cumulatively, constitute sufficient prejudice to justify issuing the writ."); Hough v. Anderson, 272 F.3d 878, 891 n.3 (7th Cir. 2001) (stating that "prejudice may be based on the cumulative effect of multiple errors"). But see Kennedy v. Kemna, 666 F.3d 472, 485 (8th Cir. 2012) (stating that there is no cumulation of prejudice in the Eighth Circuit); Fisher v. Angelone, 163 F.3d 835, 852 (4th Cir. 1998) ("[I]t has long been the practice of this Court individually to assess claims under [Strickland]."); Westley v. Johnson, 83 F.3d 714, 726 (5th Cir. 1996) (noting that "[m]eritless claims or claims that are not prejudicial cannot be cumulated, regardless of the total number raised").
I would defer resolution of this question to a case where it has actually been briefed and argued to us. In any event, as I read the majority opinion, it does not decide the question whether Strickland prejudice can be tallied across proceedings. For example, if a defendant files an application for postconviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, we are not deciding that the prejudicial effect of any errors alleged therein must be added to the prejudicial effect of any errors that were rejected in an earlier proceeding, such as a direct appeal, on the ground that their cumulative effect was insufficiently prejudicial.
Waterman, J., joins this special concurrence.
