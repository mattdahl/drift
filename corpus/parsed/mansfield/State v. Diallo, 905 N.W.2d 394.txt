ly concurring).
I concur in the judgment. Applying the standard described in my dissent in State v. Weitzel, 901 N.W.2d 838 (2017), I would hold that substantial compliance with Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.8(2)(b) did not occur. First, unlike in Weitzel, the fine assessed was greater than the maximum fine disclosed to the defendant—i.e., $425 (including the surcharge) versus $315. Second, the defendant here pled guilty to a single serious misdemeanor—assault causing bodily injury—and received ten days in jail, not a substantial prison term as in Weitzel. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the written plea agreement itself called for a $315 fine, with no reference to a potential surcharge. It was signed by the prosecutor, the defense attorney, and the defendant. With a plea agreement, the  standard is strict compliance, not substantial compliance. See State v. Fannon, 799 N.W.2d 515, 522 (Iowa 2011); State v. Bearse, 748 N.W.2d 211, 215 (Iowa 2008). For the foregoing reasons, I join the judgment of the court vacating the defendant's guilty plea and remanding for further proceedings.1 
Waterman, J., joins this special concurrence.
