Concur




MANSFIELD, J. (concurring specially)
I believe that Stacia makes a fairly compelling case that Luke has not been meeting his parental responsibilities toward Jordan. Since January 2007, Luke has spent only two hours and ten minutes with his daughter. He has made no effort to communicate with her at all since January 2008. Since he became an independent contractor in November 2007, Luke has voluntarily made only three child support payments of $ 100 each. One of them coincided with a petition to reduce child support. The other two occurred after Stacia filed her petition. Somewhat disturbingly, Luke seems to be taking a much greater interest in financially supporting and seeing his son, who also does not live with him. In addition, the guardian ad litem in this case supported termination of Luke's parental rights to Jordan.
Having said this, I agree that the juvenile court's ruling should be affirmed because there is no clear and convincing evidence at this time that termination of parental rights would be in Jordan's best interests. As the juvenile court pointed out, "There exists no person ready to stand in place of Luke to provide financial and emotional support to Jordan as her father and no prospects for a step-father have been identified."
