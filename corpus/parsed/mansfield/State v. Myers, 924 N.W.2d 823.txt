 specially).
I join the court's well-reasoned opinion. I write separately to explain why nothing precludes the State from asking the district court to consider Jeffrey Myers's potential guilt under Iowa Code section 321J.2(1)(a) (2016) on remand. As the court notes, the district court made no factual finding on that theory.
State v. Pexa is on point. See 574 N.W.2d 344 (Iowa 1998). There the state maintained that the defendant was guilty of unauthorized possession of an offensive weapon under two separate definitions of "offensive weapon." Id. at 345. Following a bench trial, the district court found the defendant guilty under the Iowa Code section 724.1(3) (1995) alternative but did not consider the section 724.1(4) alternative. Id. On appeal, we found that the evidence did not support the section 724.1(3) alternative on which the defendant was convicted by the trial court. Id. at 346. However, rather than acquitting the defendant entirely as he requested, we remanded the case for further proceedings so the court could consider and rule on the section 724.1(4) alternative. Id. at 346-47. We explained, "A failure to consider an alternative definition of the offense charged does not constitute an acquittal of that offense for double jeopardy purposes." Id. at 347.
The same analysis applies here. The district court clearly did not acquit Myers of the section 321J.2(1)(a) alternative when it said, "They could also prove you [Myers] were under the influence of something." So that alternative remains fair game on remand.
The New Mexico Court of Appeals recently cited to Pexa in a case with facts quite similar to ours. See State v. Ben, 2015-NMCA-118, 362 P.3d 180, 183 (N.M. Ct. App. 2015). In Ben, the defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) under New Mexico law. Id. at 181. The criminal complaint alleged violations of both the "per se" and the "under the influence" subsections—alternatives that mirror the options available under Iowa law. Id. After a nonjury trial, the magistrate found the defendant guilty of per se DWI but "did not refer to the impaired DWI provision." Id. Following an appeal to the district court, a jury convicted the defendant of impaired DWI but found no violation of per se DWI. Id. The defendant appealed further, arguing that his district court conviction on the impaired theory of DWI violated double jeopardy. Id. As the New Mexico Court of Appeals explained,
Defendant divides the single offense of DWI into its alternative theories, contending that his conviction in the first trial on one theory of DWI (the per se theory) necessarily constitutes an implied acquittal on the alternative theory on which no conviction was entered (the impaired DWI theory).
Id. at 183.
The court disagreed with this argument and elaborated as follows:
When a defendant is convicted based on one of two alternative means of committing a single crime, which is the situation presented in this case, the near uniform majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue have refused to imply an acquittal on the other alternative. See United States v. Ham, 58 F.3d 78, 84-86 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Wood, 958 F.2d 963, 971-72 (10th Cir. 1992); United States ex rel. Jackson v. Follette, 462 F.2d 1041, 1047, 1049-50 (2d Cir. 1972); Beebe v. Nelson,  37 F. Supp. 2d 1304, 1308 (D. Kan. 1999); Schiro v. State, 533 N.E.2d 1201, 1207-08 (Ind. 1989); State v. Pexa, 574 N.W.2d 344, 347 (Iowa 1998) ("A failure to consider an alternative definition of the offense charged does not constitute an acquittal of that offense for double jeopardy purposes."); State v. Wade, 284 Kan. 527, 161 P.3d 704, 715 (2007); Commonwealth v. Carlino, 449 Mass. 71, 865 N.E.2d 767, 774-75 (2007); People v. Jackson, 20 N.Y.2d 440, 285 N.Y.S.2d 8, 231 N.E.2d 722, 728-30 (1967); State v. Wright, 165 Wash. 2d 783, 203 P.3d 1027, 1035 (2009) (en banc); State v. Kent, 223 W. Va. 520, 678 S.E.2d 26, 30-33 (2009); cf. State v. Terwilliger, 314 Conn. 618, 104 A.3d 638, 651-52 (2014) (refusing to imply an acquittal where a general verdict form made it impossible to know which theory supported the defendant's conviction); Torrez, 2013-NMSC-034, ¶¶ 10-14, 305 P.3d 944 (same). But see Terry v. Potter, 111 F.3d 454, 458 (6th Cir. 1997); State v. Hescock, 98 Wash. App. 600, 989 P.2d 1251, 1256-57 (1999) (applying Terry).
Id.
It is also worth noting that the official toxicology report from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) lab is part of the trial record here. It was included in the minutes, and no one objected to its being considered. Thus, while I agree that this lab report is not enough to prove that Myers was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt under the Iowa Code section 321J.2(1)(c) (2016) alternative, it is evidence that may be taken into account in determining Myers's guilt or innocence under section 321J.2(1)(a).
Waterman and Christensen, JJ., join this special concurrence.
