ly concurring). The Williams majority devoted a section of the opinion to stare decisis. See id. at 859-60 (majority opinion). The dissent lectured about the importance of the doctrine and pointedly "call[ed] for the restoration of the principle of stare decisis in Iowa jurisprudence." Id. at 870 (Wiggins, J., dissenting). Yet today the same members of this court say nothing about stare decisis and overrule countless decisions without showing that our guilty plea precedent was clearly erroneous or unworkable.
Iowa law requires a detailed guilty plea colloquy to satisfy the court that the defendant's plea is knowing and voluntary and that there is a factual basis for the crime. See Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.8(2)(b); see also Diaz v. State, 896 N.W.2d 723, 732-34 (Iowa 2017) (vacating guilty plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel because plea colloquy failed to address the postdeportation immigration consequences of the conviction). Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.8 requires the court to determine "the plea is made voluntarily and intelligently and has a factual basis." Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.8(2)(b). Before accepting a plea, the court must address the defendant in  open court and determine if he or she understands
(1) The nature of the charge to which the plea is offered.
(2) The mandatory minimum punishment, if any, and the maximum possible punishment provided by the statute defining the offense to which the plea is offered.
(3) That a criminal conviction, deferred judgment, or deferred sentence may affect a defendant's status under federal immigration laws.
(4) That the defendant has the right to be tried by a jury, and at trial has the right to assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against the defendant, the right not to be compelled to incriminate oneself, and the right to present witnesses in the defendant's own behalf and to have compulsory process in securing their attendance.
(5) That if the defendant pleads guilty there will not be a further trial of any kind, so that by pleading guilty the defendant waives the right to a trial.
Id. The court also must inquire "whether the defendant's willingness to plead guilty results from prior discussions between the attorney for the state and the defendant or the defendant's attorney" and disclose the plea agreement on the record. Id. r. 2.8(2)(c). Schmidt alleges no violation of rule 2.8 in this PCR action.
Here, the district court fully complied with rule 2.8 in accepting Schmidt's guilty plea. The district court described the legal rights Schmidt would have if he withdrew the plea and went to trial, and Schmidt informed the court he understood his rights and wished to plead guilty to the charges. The court reviewed the factual basis for each count. The prosecutor recited the elements of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse and the maximum and minimum penalties for that offense. After confirming Schmidt understood, the court inquired whether the minutes of testimony were accurate concerning this offense:
THE COURT: . . . What I am trying to find out is with regard to the elements of this crime, I'm talking about assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, and we have described those elements to you, in connection with those elements, do the Minutes of Testimony, that is what the witnesses would say at trial, do they accurately and truthfully tell us what you did?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
. . . .
THE COURT: Just tell me what you did that makes you think you are guilty.
THE DEFENDANT: I grabbed a child and tried to perform a sex act against his will.
. . . .
THE COURT: Is [B.C.] the person you tried to commit a sex act with?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
THE COURT: Did this occur on or about February 25th, 2006, in Woodbury County, Iowa?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
THE COURT: Do you understand that by grabbing him, the state alleges you assaulted him by that grabbing? Do you understand that?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
THE COURT: The state claims that by grabbing him and making this attempt, that this was offensive to [B.C.]. Do you agree that [B.C.] could have found this grabbing offensive?
THE DEFENDANT: Probably, sir.
THE COURT: The state claims that when you grabbed him, you did so with the specific intent to commit a sex act,  and you said that you did grab him in an attempt to commit a sex act; is that correct?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
THE COURT: So was that your specific intent? That was your intention at the time?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
THE COURT: Now, a sex act in this case, the state alleges that you were attempting to make contact between your penis and anus of [B.C.]. That's what they are claiming. Is that what happened?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
. . . .
THE COURT: Mr. Schmidt, are you telling me you are, in fact, guilty to this crime of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
Next, the prosecutor recited the elements of incest and the maximum and minimum penalties. After confirming Schmidt understood, the court engaged in another colloquy:
THE COURT: . . . With regard to the elements of this crime of incest, do these summaries of what the witnesses would say with regard to the elements of that crime, truthfully and accurately describe what you did?
THE DEFENDANT: Okay. I performed the sex act—Yes, sir. Those are accurate.
. . . .
THE COURT: Now I need to have you tell me in your own words what you did that makes you think that you are guilty of this charge.
THE DEFENDANT: I performed a sex act on a minor child.
. . . .
THE COURT: The state claims that the sex act that you performed was contact between your penis and [B.C.'s] anus. Do you agree that that was the contact that was performed?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
. . . .
THE COURT: Do you agree that at the time that you performed the sex act upon [B.C.] that he was your brother?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
Schmidt told the court he was satisfied with the services of his counsel. The court accepted Schmidt's guilty plea, finding the plea was "made voluntarily and intelligently" and Schmidt "underst[ood] the legal rights that he [was] giving up by pleading guilty to each of these two charges." Schmidt does not challenge those findings, which the district court and court of appeals correctly determined required the summary dismissal of his PCR action.
A plea must "be a genuine one, by a defendant who is guilty; one who understands his situation, his rights, and the consequences of the plea, and is neither deceived nor coerced." State v. Hinners, 471 N.W.2d 841, 843 (Iowa 1991) (quoting State v. Whitehead, 163 N.W.2d 899, 902 (Iowa 1969)). A guilty plea is effectively a confession of committing the crime made under judicial oversight with representation by defense counsel. See Woods v. State, 52 Kan. App. 2d 958, 379 P.3d 1134, 1141 (Kan. Ct. App. 2016). That is what we have here. As the United States Supreme Court has held, "A plea of guilty is more than a voluntary confession made in open court. It also serves as a stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need b[e] advanced . . . . It supplies both evidence and verdict, ending controversy." Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 n.4, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 1712 n.4, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969) (alteration in original) (quoting Woodard v. State, 42 Ala. App. 552, 171 So. 2d 462, 469 (Ala. Ct. App. 1965));  see also Class, 583 U.S. at    , 138 S. Ct. at 804 (majority opinion) ("The plea of guilty is, of course, a confession of all the facts charged in the indictment, and also of the evil intent imputed to the defendant." (quoting Commonwealth v. Hinds, 101 Mass. 209, 210 (1869))). For this reason, the United States Supreme Court and, until today, our court has upheld knowing and voluntary guilty pleas. See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 757, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1473, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1970) ("A defendant is not entitled to withdraw his plea merely because he discover[ed] long after the plea has been accepted that his calculus misapprehended the quality of the State's case or the likely penalties attached to alternative courses of action."); Speed, 573 N.W.2d at 597 ("The fact that an accused may elect to plead guilty to a lesser offense when he is also charged with a more serious offense does not make his plea coerced." (quoting State v. Lindsey, 171 N.W.2d 859, 865 (Iowa 1969))).
Schmidt relies on People v. Whirl, which allowed postconviction claims to proceed to challenge a conviction resulting from a guilty plea following a confession coerced by police torture. 2015 IL App (1st) 111483, 395 Ill. Dec. 647, 39 N.E.3d 114, 117 (Ill. App. Ct. 2015). That case is inapposite because Schmidt claims no torture, coercion, or other constitutional violation in connection with his guilty plea.
[W]hen a defendant pleads guilty, the case is effectively closed. The [prosecutor] believes that he or she will no longer need to develop the case for presentation to a jury, and investigation and witness identification ceases. Similarly, victims believe that the case is over. Unlike a conviction by trial, which the defendant can appeal and continue to contest vigorously, when a defendant enters a plea, he or she admits wrongdoing.
People v. Schneider, 25 P.3d 755, 760 (Colo. 2001) (en banc); see also Commonwealth v. Martinez, 372 Pa. Super. 202, 539 A.2d 399, 401 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988) ("After a defendant has entered a plea of guilty the only cognizable issues in a [postconviction] proceeding are the validity of the plea of guilty and the legality of the sentence."). The State should be able to rely on the finality of guilty pleas such as Schmidt's entered in compliance with Iowa law. As Justice Alito observed, "Roughly 95% of felony cases in the federal and state courts are resolved by guilty pleas. Therefore it is critically important that defendants, prosecutors, and judges understand the consequences of these pleas." Class, 583 U.S. at    , 138 S. Ct. at 807 (Alito, J., dissenting).
The majority's holding undermines the value of guilty pleas. "One of the benefits to the state from a plea bargain is finality." Rhoades v. State, 880 N.W.2d 431, 447-49 (Iowa 2016) (holding guilty plea barred recovery for wrongful imprisonment). Other "factors favoring pleas include risk avoidance, conservation of prosecution and court resources, efficiency, and timeliness of disposition." Id. at 449. The State (and victims) can no longer rely on the finality of guilty pleas. If Schmidt had gone to trial in 2007, the State presumably would have proven its case then, and trial testimony would have been preserved for any retrial. Not so when trial preparation is short-circuited by a guilty plea and no trial takes place. See id. (noting the lack of a trial record when the defendant pleads guilty).
The majority fails to confront the proof problems that arise when a defendant is allowed to renege on a guilty plea years later and there is no prior trial record because of his guilty plea. Other courts avoid such problems by enforcing the guilty plea. See Weeks v. Bowersox, 119 F.3d 1342, 1355 (8th Cir. 1997) (Loken, J.,  concurring) (acknowledging the "inherent paradox in the notion that someone who has stood in open court and declared, 'I am guilty,' may turn around years later" and claim postconviction relief); Norris v. State, 896 N.E.2d 1149, 1153 (Ind. 2008) (noting the difficulty in "harmoniz[ing] th[e] new position taken by the defendant with the fact that he originally admitted to committing the crime by his guilty plea," given that "[b]oth his confession and his new claims cannot be true"); Yonga v. State, 221 Md. App. 45, 108 A.3d 448, 461-63 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2015) (explaining that new evidence cannot be compared to a nonexistent trial record), aff'd 446 Md. 183, 130 A.3d 486, 492 (Md. 2016) (concluding "that a person who has pled guilty may not later avail himself or herself of the relief afforded by the Petition for a Writ of Actual Innocence").
The district court correctly granted the State's motion for summary judgment. Relying on the court of appeals recent decision in Walters v. State, the district court found that "newly-discovered exculpatory evidence does not provide grounds to withdraw a guilty plea 'unless it is intrinsic to the plea itself.'" 843 N.W.2d 477, 2014 Iowa App. LEXIS 10, *7, 2014 WL 69589, at *3 (Iowa Ct. App. 2014) (quoting Speed, 573 N.W.2d at 596). The court of appeals correctly affirmed the district court's summary judgment dismissing Schmidt's PCR action. The court of appeals found "the analysis and reasoning in Walters to be spot-on" and held that "because Schmidt's convictions were entered following his guilty pleas, he cannot challenge those convictions in a PCR action on the basis of newly discovered evidence in the form of his victim's alleged recantation." I agree.
Nothing in today's majority opinion should preclude the State from introducing Schmidt's guilty plea colloquy into evidence at the postremand hearing. In my view, Schmidt's admissions of guilt in 2007 entitle the State to summary dismissal of his PCR claims. See Castro, 795 N.W.2d at 795.
 II. B.C.'s "Recantation" Is Insufficient to Vacate Schmidt's Guilty Plea.
We have never vacated a guilty plea based on the victim's recantation. The majority fails to mention that "[w]e have repeatedly held that a witness' recantation testimony . . . is looked upon with the utmost suspicion." Jones v. State, 479 N.W.2d 265, 275 (Iowa 1991). Our skepticism of recantations is widely shared. Haouari v. United States, 510 F.3d 350, 353 (2d Cir. 2007) ("It is axiomatic that witness recantations 'must be looked upon with the utmost suspicion.'" (quoting Ortega v. Duncan, 333 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir. 2003))); see also Yonga, 108 A.3d at 475 (noting "post-trial recantation[s] of witnesses are looked on with the utmost suspicion" (quoting Carr v. State, 39 Md. App. 478, 387 A.2d 302, 305-06 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (Md. 1979))); Addai v. State, 2017 ND 98, 893 N.W.2d 480, 483 (N.D. 2017) ("This Court reviews recanting testimony with suspicion and disfavor.").
This is because recantations "upset[] society's interest in the finality of convictions, [are] very often unreliable and given for suspect motives, and most often serve[] merely to impeach cumulative evidence rather than to undermine confidence in the accuracy of the conviction."
Haouari, 510 F.3d at 354 (alterations in original) (quoting Dobbert v. Wainwright, 468 U.S. 1231, 1233-34, 105 S. Ct. 34, 36, 82 L. Ed. 2d 925 (1984) (Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)).
Our distrust is heightened when the recanting victim is a child sexually abused by a family member. See, e.g., State v. Kostman,  585 N.W.2d 209, 210 (Iowa 1998) (per curiam) ("The victim further admitted he once recanted the allegations because he and Kostman 'went camping together and always had fun and [he] didn't want to see nothing happen to him and it was just—[he] was just kind of scared.'" (Alteration in original.)). In State v. Tharp, the defendant's stepdaughter recanted her testimony that he had sexually abused her. 372 N.W.2d 280, 282 (Iowa Ct. App. 1985). The district court denied his motion for new trial. Id. The court of appeals affirmed, observing,
A witness' recantation of her testimony is looked upon with the utmost suspicion, and does not necessarily entitle the defendant to a new trial. The trial court must make its decision based on the facts of the whole trial and those in conjunction with the motion. The victim was a 15 year old stepdaughter of defendant. In cases of this type, where families are torn apart, there is great pressure on the child to "make things right."
Id. (footnote omitted) (citations omitted).
This view too is widely shared. See United States v. Provost, 969 F.2d 617, 621 (8th Cir. 1992) ("Recantation is particularly common when family members are involved and the child has feelings of guilt or the family members seek to influence the child to change her story."); Myatt v. Hannigan, 910 F.2d 680, 685 n.2 (10th Cir. 1990) ("[T]he child's recanting of her statement to family members is not atypical in sex abuse cases."); Schneider, 25 P.3d at 763 ("Skepticism about recantations is especially applicable in cases of child sexual abuse where recantation is a recurring phenomenon."); State v. Gallagher, 150 Vt. 341, 554 A.2d 221, 225 (Vt. 1988) (allowing hearsay exception for child victims of sex crimes because of "the high probability of a child victim recanting a statement about being abused sexually"); see also Norris, 896 N.E.2d at 1155 (Boehm, J. concurring) (viewing recantation of victim's mother as "inherently somewhat suspect, coming as it does after the fact and from [a] relative[] of the defendant").9 
Recantations are especially common with victims of domestic violence. See State v. Smith, 876 N.W.2d 180, 187-88 (Iowa 2016) (citing authorities concluding many victims of domestic violence recant); id. at 194 (Waterman, J., dissenting) ("The rate of recantation among domestic violence victims has been estimated between eighty and ninety percent."). After today, we can  expect that offenders who already pled guilty will try to pressure their victims to recant.
Mindful of the law's appropriate distrust of recantations by victims of child sex abuse, I conclude B.C.'s fainthearted "recantation" is insufficient to vacate Schmidt's guilty plea. B.C.'s affidavit stated in its entirety:
I, [B.C.], being first duly sworn hereby depose and state as follows:
I was the victim in Woodbury County Criminal Case FECR054257, State of Iowa vs. Jacob Schmidt. Jacob Schmidt is my brother. I am currently 23 years of age, but was a child at the time of the criminal case. At the time of the original criminal case, I had told various people that Jacob had sexually abused me. When I was 21 years old, I told other people that Jacob had never touched me in a sexual way or sexually abused me. I didn't tell anyone before that date that nothing had really happened, and so Jacob couldn't have known before then. I decided to tell people when I turned 21 since I was a full adult at that time. I want to see my brother and tell him I am sorry that I couldn't tell anyone before then.
Notably, B.C. never stated under oath which story he told is true. Nor did B.C. claim that police or his family induced him to lie in 2007. The timing of B.C.'s new story seven years later coincides with Schmidt's expected release from prison. On February 25, 2006, the night Peter caught Schmidt in the act of attempting to rape B.C., Schmidt stood six foot, three inches tall and weighed between 350 and 400 pounds. B.C., who had just celebrated his fourteenth birthday, was four feet, six inches tall and weighed between seventy-five and ninety pounds. While B.C. may have added some pounds and inches since then, I can understand his motivation to make peace with his much larger half-brother before Schmidt's release from prison.
Perhaps an evidentiary hearing on remand will bring this matter to a swift conclusion. "The trial court is not required to believe the recantation . . . ." State v. Compiano, 261 Iowa 509, 517, 154 N.W.2d 845, 849 (1967). To the contrary, if the court believes the recantation is false,
and is not reasonably well satisfied that the testimony given by the witness [at] trial was false, . . . it is not at liberty to shift upon the shoulders of another jury the responsibility to seek out the truth of that matter.
Id.
We have repeatedly affirmed denials of applications for postconviction relief based on witness recantations. See Jones, 479 N.W.2d at 275 (affirming district court's denial of application for PCR because "Jones' entire claim is based upon an assumption that Coleman's trial testimony was in fact false," but "[t]he postconviction court is certainly not required to believe the recantation"); State v. Folck, 325 N.W.2d 368, 377 (Iowa 1982) ("Recantation of trial testimony is viewed with suspicion, and the trial court has broad discretion in looking to the whole record to determine if defendant had a fair trial."); see also State v. Frank, 298 N.W.2d 324, 329 (Iowa 1980) (noting testimony later recanted still had probative value); State v. Taylor, 287 N.W.2d 576, 578 (Iowa 1980) (affirming denial of motion for new trial because a recantation is "not really based on newly discovered evidence"); State v. Jackson, 223 N.W.2d 229, 234 (Iowa 1974) ("The general rule is a witness' recantation should be looked upon with utmost suspicion.").
When the witness's original testimony is corroborated by other evidence supporting the conviction following a jury trial, a subsequent  recantation seldom warrants relief. See Adcock v. State, 528 N.W.2d 645, 648 (Iowa Ct. App. 1994) (affirming district court's denial of postconviction relief when witness recanted because "there was other evidence connecting Adcock to the crime"); see also Frank, 298 N.W.2d at 329-30 (affirming conviction when independent evidence corroborated witness's original testimony that she later recanted). Peter's unrecanted eyewitness account corroborates B.C.'s original contemporaneous report to the police and forensic interviewer. Schmidt therefore is not entitled to relief from his conviction.
 III. Schmidt's PCR Action Is Untimely.
I would also affirm the summary judgment because Schmidt's PCR—filed seven years after his conviction—is time-barred under Iowa Code section 822.3's three-year statute of limitations. The majority holds it is not time-barred because Schmidt could not know within the limitations period that B.C. would later recant. But Schmidt did know what happened in the bedroom in 2006 and knew then whether the allegations made by Peter and B.C. were false.
PCR actions "must be filed within three years from the date the conviction or decision is final or, in the event of an appeal, from the date the writ of procedendo is issued." Iowa Code § 822.3 (2014). An exception is made for applications claiming "a ground of fact or law that could not have been raised within the applicable time period." Id. The three-year time-bar "limit[s] postconviction litigation in order to conserve judicial resources, promote substantive goals of the criminal law, foster rehabilitation, and restore a sense of repose in our system of justice." Wilkins v. State, 522 N.W.2d 822, 824 (Iowa 1994) (quoting State v. Edman, 444 N.W.2d 103, 106 (Iowa Ct. App. 1989)). A corollary purpose is "'to reduce injustices occurring as a result of lost witnesses' necessary to resolve factual issues arising in postconviction proceedings and upon retrial of cases where convictions have been overturned." Dible v. State, 557 N.W.2d 881, 885 (Iowa 1996) (quoting Brewer v. Iowa Dist. Ct., 395 N.W.2d 841, 843 (Iowa 1986)), abrogated on other grounds by Harrington v. State, 659 N.W.2d 509, 521 (Iowa 2003).
To further those goals, the exception to the three-year time-bar in section 822.3 is limited to claims in which the applicant had "no opportunity to test the validity of the conviction in relation to [the ground of fact or law that allegedly could not have been raised within the time period]." Wilkins, 522 N.W.2d at 824 (alteration in original) (quoting Edman, 444 N.W.2d at 106). An applicant may not assert a claim he or she has "at least been alerted to" in the prior action. Id. This promotes repose and conserves judicial resources. See id. (holding second application for relief was time-barred when applicant should have been alerted to "ground of fact" in prior postconviction application); see also Dible, 557 N.W.2d at 886 (barring action when applicant was aware of ground of fact because "[a]ny other decision would result in an endless procession of postconviction actions, and the legislature's hope to avoid stale claims and to achieve a sense of repose in the criminal justice system would not be realized").
The State filed a two-pronged motion for summary judgment to dismiss Schmidt's PCR action, arguing that his (1) guilty plea barred relief and (2) PCR application was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. The State correctly argued B.C.'s statements were not "new evidence" that could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence:
Here, by the very nature of the case and the sexual abuse claims leveled  against the applicant by his younger family member, there can be no doubt that he would have known about his own involvement or non-involvement in the alleged sexual acts against his family member. He would have known what the victim or any other witness would or would not testify to if the case were to proceed to jury trial. He would have known that the victim's father was prepared to testify that he caught the applicant in the act with his pants down, penis exposed, and kneeling right behind the bare anus of the victim in the bedroom. He would have known that the victim had given a recorded interview to Mercy CAC stating that the sexual acts did in fact occur. All of this would have been readily available to the applicant at the time of his plea of guilty and subsequent conviction and as such he would have known about the veracity of said statements.
I agree.
"[T]he objective of the escape clause of section 822.3 is to provide relief from the limitation period when an applicant had 'no opportunity' to assert the claim before the limitation period expired." Cornell v. State, 529 N.W.2d 606, 611 (Iowa Ct. App. 1994) (quoting Wilkins, 522 N.W.2d at 823-24). "[T]he focus of our inquiry has been whether the applicant was or should have been 'alerted' to the potential claim before the limitation period expired." Id. (quoting Wilkins, 522 N.W.2d at 824).10  Schmidt was alerted to his own actual-innocence claim and chose to abandon it by pleading guilty. He knew when he entered his plea whether Peter and B.C. were telling the truth and gave up his right to a trial to cross-examine them.
This is not a case in which a new, disinterested witness has come forward. See State v. Burgess, 237 Iowa 162, 164-65, 21 N.W.2d 309, 310 (1946) (allowing new trial based on subsequent discovery of disinterested alibi witness, a train conductor, when the defendant "was the only witness who testified at the trial that he was on the train at the time the state's witnesses testified the crime was committed [elsewhere, because c]learly the evidence of the conductor of the train, placing the [defendant] on the train at the time of the commission of the crime, was not cumulative"). And this is not the case of a mere he-said, he-said account without another witness to the incident.11  Peter walked in on and witnessed  Schmidt's attempted assault on B.C.
Nor has Schmidt come forward with new physical evidence or new scientific developments that were previously undiscovered.12 See More v. State, 880 N.W.2d 487, 508 (Iowa 2016) (considering as newly discovered evidence FBI announcement that previous testimony on bullet identification was "not scientifically supportable").
B.C.'s recantation is "not new evidence in the real sense." Compiano, 261 Iowa at 517, 154 N.W.2d at 849. "On the contrary, it is but an assertion by affidavit that the former testimony given by the witness was false." Id.; see also Taylor, 287 N.W.2d at 578 (same). As the Kansas Court of Appeals stated,
By entering a plea of guilty, Woods was well aware of the facts of the case. In fact, he knew the extent of his involvement in the events of the evening better than anyone else. Based on the preliminary hearing, the pretrial motions filed with the court, and the documents exchanged by the parties, Woods knew that at least on the planned day of trial . . . some witnesses were going to testify on his behalf and some were not. He freely and voluntarily chose not to take his chances with a trial. The fact that at some point on or after [the trial date], some—though not all—witnesses appear to have recanted previous incriminating statements or returned to original statements does not change the fact that Woods decided not to risk the consequences of facing a trial . . . .
Woods, 379 P.3d at 1141.
Our decision in Harrington, 659 N.W.2d 509, does not require a different result. In Harrington, we stated that newly discovered, previously undisclosed police reports together with recantations by three trial witnesses qualified as a ground of fact that could not have been raised within the three-year window. 659 N.W.2d at 521. A jury found Terry Harrington guilty of murder in 1978. Id. at 514. Harrington had presented an alibi defense at trial that was undermined by several witnesses who placed him with accomplices on the night of the murder. Id. at 515. Over twenty years later, Harrington filed an application for postconviction relief. Id. Three witnesses had come forward, recanting their trial testimony that placed him with accomplices. Id. at 516-17. One recanting witness "claim[ed] he gave a contrary story at trial because he was pressured by the prosecutors and police." Id. at 517. Another "said he lied [at trial] to obtain a $5000 reward . . . and to avoid being charged with the crime." Id. Harrington's counsel also discovered Brady violations—eight police reports containing exculpatory  information withheld by the state.13 Id. at 518-19. "Harrington argued this newly discovered evidence warranted vacation of his conviction." Id. at 518. Concluding we were bound by the district court's factual findings, we stated,
With respect to both the undisclosed police reports and the recantation evidence, the [district] court held, in ruling on Harrington's substantive claims, that he had proved they were discovered after the verdict in his criminal trial and that they could not have been discovered earlier than they were discovered in the exercise of due diligence. These findings are clearly supported by substantial evidence, which we have reviewed above, and so are binding under the standard of review applicable to the statute-of-limitations issue.
Id. at 521. We concluded Harrington's PCR application was not time-barred, see id., but went on to determine the Brady violations alone entitled him to a new trial, id. at 525.
Harrington is distinguishable. Schmidt alleges no Brady violations. No unrecanting eyewitness caught Harrington in the criminal act. The district court made no finding B.C.'s recantation was newly discovered evidence. And B.C. makes no claim he was paid or pressured to testify falsely when Schmidt was charged. Most significantly, unlike Schmidt, Harrington did not plead guilty but steadfastly maintained his innocence. Id. at 523 & n.10.
 IV. Schmidt's Actual-Innocence Claim Fails.
The majority today adopts for the first time a freestanding actual-innocence claim for postconviction relief. Under this new standard,
[f]or an applicant to succeed on a freestanding actual-innocence claim, the applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that, despite the evidence of guilt supporting the conviction, no reasonable fact finder could convict the applicant of the crimes for which the sentencing court found the applicant guilty in light of all the evidence, including the newly discovered evidence.
In my view, Schmidt fails to meet this standard as a matter of law.
The Supreme Court has stated that an applicant claiming actual innocence must present "new reliable evidence—whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence—that was not presented at trial." Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 324, 115 S. Ct. 851, 865, 130 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1995). Requiring new reliable evidence significantly reduces "[t]he threat to judicial resources, finality, and comity posed by claims of actual innocence." Id. at 324, 115 S. Ct. at 866. Assessing reliability, "the court may consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that evidence." Id. at 332, 115 S. Ct. at 869.
Moreover, to succeed on an actual-innocence claim, the applicant also must show that "a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent." Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct. 2639, 2649, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1986). The court must therefore assess the merits of the claim, considering "'all the evidence,' old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under 'rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.'" House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 538, 126 S. Ct. 2064, 2077, 165 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (quoting Schlup, 513  U.S. at 327-28, 115 S. Ct. at 867). Most importantly, the applicant must show it is "more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence." Id. at 556, 126 S. Ct. at 2087 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Schlup, 513 U.S. at 327, 115 S. Ct. at 867). This requires more than a showing that "reasonable doubt exists in the light of the new evidence." Schlup, 513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868. Rather, the applicant must prove "no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." Id. This standard is "demanding and permits review only in the 'extraordinary' case." House, 547 U.S. at 538, 126 S. Ct. at 2077 (majority opinion) (quoting Schlup, 513 U.S. at 327, 115 S. Ct. at 867). Because the inquiry "involves evidence the trial [court] did not have before it, the inquiry requires the . . . court to assess how reasonable jurors would [have] react[ed] to the overall, newly supplemented record." Id. at 538, 126 S. Ct. at 2078.
Schmidt cannot show it is more likely than not in light of B.C.'s recantation that no reasonable juror would have convicted him. Peter personally witnessed Schmidt's attempt to sexually assault B.C., literally catching them with their pants down. Police officers took contemporaneous statements from Peter and B.C. at the scene within minutes of the incident. The police officers could have testified as to what B.C. and Peter described minutes after the incident under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. See Iowa R. Evid. 5.803(2) (defining excited utterance as "[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused"); see also State v. Richards, 809 N.W.2d 80, 95 (Iowa 2012) (holding domestic violence victim's statement to daughter about choking while victim's neck was still red was admissible as an excited utterance). Moreover, B.C. gave a recorded forensic interview five days later in which he detailed the events of the night and disclosed Schmidt's past assaults. That video, recorded while his memory was fresh, could be used to impeach his subsequent recantation. See Iowa R. Evid. 5.613(b) ("Extrinsic evidence of a witness's prior inconsistent statement is admissible only if the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement and an adverse party is given an opportunity to examine the witness about it, or if justice so requires."); see also State v. Austin, 585 N.W.2d 241, 243-44 (Iowa 1998) (concluding district court properly admitted videotape of child victim describing sexual abuse recorded shortly after it occurred, when defense counsel opened the door by cross-examining the child about inconsistent statements); Chambers v. State, 805 S.W.2d 459, 461 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (en banc) (allowing jury to consider recorded statement of child discussing abuse despite child's recantation at trial); State v. Church, 167 Vt. 604, 708 A.2d 1341, 1342 (Vt. 1998) (allowing state to present rehabilitating testimony from witness whom child told she had been abused after defendant attempted to show child had recanted her testimony).
Schmidt's claim of actual innocence in this PCR action must be evaluated in light of that evidence and, as the special concurrence acknowledges, Schmidt's guilty-plea colloquy in which he admitted to the facts in the minutes of testimony establishing his crimes. See Castro, 795 N.W.2d at 795 (approving use of plea colloquy in summary disposition). Schmidt cannot succeed on his actual-innocence claim based solely on B.C.'s recantation; he cannot show no reasonable juror would convict him. I would hold that the district court properly granted the State's motion for summary  dismissal of Schmidt's petition for postconviction relief.
This case falls outside the typical categories of cases of actual innocence. In Rhoades, we reviewed a growing body of scholarship on wrongful convictions. 880 N.W.2d at 434-39. Retrospective studies of cases following DNA exonerations found the wrongful convictions "were frequently based upon false confessions obtained from the defendant [during police interrogations], eyewitness identification that proved to be unreliable, failure of the state to turn over exculpatory evidence, use of unreliable informant testimony, and ineffective assistance of counsel." Id. at 435-36 (footnotes omitted). Schmidt alleges none of those.
Most wrongful convictions followed trials in which the defendant (unlike Schmidt) steadfastly maintained his or her innocence.14  Yet "[t]hirteen percent of all wrongful convictions listed in the National Registry of Exonerations are the result of guilty pleas." Id. at 437. We stated, "Many scholars now recognize that at least in some circumstances, an innocent person may rationally decide to plead guilty." Id. at 436. Several of those circumstances are inapplicable to Schmidt: pleas to obtain immediate release for time served or pleas based on misunderstanding the elements of the crime or facts alleged. See id. at 437. Rather, Schmidt claims he pled guilty to avoid the risk of a thirty-five-year prison sentence. See id. at 436 ("[W]hen the deal is good enough, it is rational to refuse to roll the dice . . . regardless of whether one is factually innocent." (quoting Russell D. Covey, Longitudinal Guilt: Repeat Offenders, Plea Bargaining, and the Variable Standard of Proof, 63 Fla. L. Rev. 431, 450 (2011))). But, we previously made clear the pressure a defendant faces to plea bargain to avoid a much longer prison sentence does not render his guilty plea involuntary or justify withdrawing a plea based on newly discovered exculpatory evidence. See Speed, 573 N.W.2d at 597 ("Speed's concern that he must choose between trial on a murder charge and pleading guilty to a lesser charge has no bearing upon the voluntariness of his plea."). Schmidt's is a poor test case to adopt an actual-innocence pathway to vacating a constitutionally valid guilty plea.
Accordingly, I would not use this case to decide whether to recognize a freestanding or gateway actual-innocence claim under the Iowa Constitution for postconviction-relief  actions because under any such test, Schmidt cannot satisfy the showing required for procedural or substantive relief from his guilty plea. Our court should exercise restraint today rather than trying to set the table now for a meritorious actual-innocence claim that may come to us in the future. As we stated in State v. Keeton, "fundamental principles of judicial restraint limit our role to deciding each case on the issues presented, and we refrain from deciding issues not presented by the facts." 710 N.W.2d 531, 533-34 (Iowa 2006). I would wait for a case presenting compelling proof of actual innocence before deciding the parameters for allowing postconviction challenges to defect-free guilty pleas. As our court unanimously reiterated in Keeton,
[w]e recognize the law to be an evolving process that often makes the resolution of legal questions a composite of several cases, from which appellate courts can gain a better view of the puzzle before arranging all the pieces. The wisdom of this process has been revealed time and again, and we continue to subscribe to it today.
Id. at 534 (quoting State v. Williams, 695 N.W.2d 23, 30 (Iowa 2005)).
For all these reasons, I dissent.
Mansfield and Zager, JJ., join this dissent.
MANSFIELD, Justice (dissenting).
I respectfully dissent. Constitutional interpretation is not Darwinian evolution, and a decision of this court today is not superior to the decisions that preceded it just because it is more recent. Whether this court is on a "constitutional march to become better" should be determined by others, not by ourselves.
While it is tempting to agree that "[i]nnocent people should always have a forum to prove their innocence," the realities of any criminal justice system are more complex. Even the majority does not take this statement literally. For example, even the majority accepts for now the limits in Iowa Code chapter 822 on claims brought by those who say they are actually innocent.
I join Justice Waterman's dissent, and write separately only to highlight several points.
First, this case does not involve an actual recantation.
Second, the rule that a guilty plea waives all defenses and objections which are not intrinsic to the plea is both long-standing and sound.
Third, the court has provided no doctrinal basis for grounding an actual-innocence claim in the Iowa Constitution.
Fourth, the court leaves many questions unanswered that will have to be sorted out by our district judges in the coming years.
 I. The Supposed Recantation Is Not a Recantation.
Here is the so-called recantation that is launching a thousand ships:
I was the victim in [case number]. Jacob Schmidt is my brother. I am currently 23 years of age, but was a child at the time of the criminal case. At the time of the original criminal case, I had told various people that Jacob had sexually abused me. When I was 21 years old, I told other people that Jacob had never touched me in a sexual way or sexually abused me. I didn't tell anyone before that date that nothing had really happened, and so Jacob couldn't have known before then. I decided to tell people when I turned 21 since I was a full adult at that time. I want to see my brother and tell him I am sorry that I couldn't tell anyone before then.
 This is hardly a recantation. Nowhere does Schmidt's brother deny that the sexual assault actually occurred. He merely states that he has recently been telling people it didn't occur. Nor does the brother explain why he changed his story.
Just two years ago, in Estate of Gray ex rel. Gray v. Baldi, we applied the "contradictory affidavit rule." 880 N.W.2d 451, 463-64 (Iowa 2016). Under this rule, an affidavit that contradicts prior sworn testimony does not create an issue of fact if it "clearly and unambiguously contradicts [the] earlier sworn testimony" unless the affiant offers "a reasonable explanation for any apparent contradiction." Id. Since the court purports to be applying civil summary judgment standards, Estate of Gray may well indicate that there is no issue of fact here, even if a change in our long-standing law on guilty pleas were appropriate.
 II. We Should Stand by Our Existing Law on the Finality of Guilty Pleas.
A change in the law is not needed. Our court should adhere to its long-standing rule that "a defendant's guilty plea waives all defenses and objections which are not intrinsic to the plea." State v. Carroll, 767 N.W.2d 638, 641 (Iowa 2009).
A. Our Precedent Is Clear and Well-Settled. In Carroll, we accurately said that this rule is "well-established." Id. I would not abandon our settled precedent, unanimously reaffirmed eight years ago in Carroll and two years after that in State v. Utter. See State v. Utter, 803 N.W.2d 647, 651 (Iowa 2011) (quoting Carroll with approval and explaining its significance); see also Castro v. State, 795 N.W.2d 789, 792 (Iowa 2011) ("Generally, a criminal defendant waives all defenses and objections to the criminal proceedings by pleading guilty."); State v. Mattly, 513 N.W.2d 739, 740-41 (Iowa 1994) (stating that "a valid guilty plea waives all defenses and objections (except that the information or indictment charges no offense or any irregularities intrinsic in the plea itself)"); State v. Garner, 469 N.W.2d 698, 699 (Iowa 1991) ("By pleading guilty . . . , Garner waived the right to challenge those convictions on any ground not intrinsic to the pleas."); State v. Everett, 372 N.W.2d 235, 237 (Iowa 1985) ("[A] guilty plea would have waived all defenses or objections which were not intrinsic to the plea itself."); State v. Boge, 252 N.W.2d 411, 413 (Iowa 1977) ("[B]y entering a plea of guilty, defendant waived any defense or objection which is not intrinsic to the plea itself.").
What does "intrinsic to the plea" mean? It means a defendant who pleads guilty can later argue that the plea was "unintelligent or involuntary." Carroll, 767 N.W.2d at 642-44. This includes the situation where the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel "in connection with the plea." Id. at 642. All such matters are intrinsic to the plea. But later-discovered evidence—by definition—is extrinsic to the plea.
In State v. Speed, 573 N.W.2d 594 (Iowa 1998), we specifically held that new exculpatory evidence is not intrinsic to the plea and cannot be used to challenge a guilty plea. We explained,
Speed asserts new exculpatory evidence bears upon a defendant's plea because the amount of evidence the State has against a defendant affects the defendant's decision to plead guilty. This argument fails to distinguish between a defendant's tactical rationale for pleading guilty and a defendant's understanding of what a plea means and his or her choice to voluntarily enter the plea. Any subsequently-discovered deficiency in the State's case that affects a defendant's  assessment of the evidence against him, but not the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea, is not intrinsic to the plea itself.
Id. at 596.
State v. Alexander, 463 N.W.2d 421 (Iowa 1990), likewise reiterated that "a plea of guilty 'waives all defenses or objections which are not intrinsic to the plea itself.'" Id. at 422 (quoting State v. Morehouse, 316 N.W.2d 884, 885 (Iowa 1982), overruled on other grounds by State v. Kress, 636 N.W.2d 12, 20 (Iowa 2001)). In Alexander, we relied on this rule to hold that a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence was not available for a defendant who had pled guilty. Id. at 422-23. We said, "Notions of newly discovered evidence simply have no bearing on a knowing and voluntary admission of guilt." Id. at 423.
It is true that Alexander contains the following enigmatic sentence at the end of the opinion: "The remedy Alexander seeks is available to him in the form of postconviction relief. See Iowa Code § 663A.2(4) (1989) [now Iowa Code § 822.2(1)(d) (2014)]." Id. The majority seizes on this single sentence to find that a defendant who pleads guilty can attack his or her guilty plea in postconviction-relief proceedings under Iowa Code section 822.2(1)(d) based on newly discovered evidence.
I am not persuaded. The one-sentence dictum from Alexander cannot be right and, indeed, is inconsistent with the rest of the Alexander opinion. See 463 N.W.2d at 422. One can attack a guilty plea on grounds extrinsic to the plea or one cannot—the case cannot stand for both propositions. Given our many other decisions upholding the rule against extrinsic attacks on a plea, including not just Alexander but also decisions that preceded and followed Alexander, the stray sentence from Alexander must be regarded as an error. Certainly, it has been treated as a legal dead end. In the nearly thirty years since we decided Alexander, that sentence has never been quoted or cited by our court. Instead, for decades, until today, we have consistently followed the rule that a guilty plea waives all defenses and objections which are not intrinsic to the plea.
Westlaw will be busy tracking down and flagging the decisions of our court that, after today, are no longer good law.
B. Our Precedent Is Sound. The rule limiting challenges to guilty pleas is not just our precedent, it is the correct precedent, especially when one considers the interests of both defendants and the state. Although the majority in my view unfairly disparages plea agreements, painting the whole process as predatory, plea negotiations are a vital element of our justice system, and they ultimately benefit—and protect—defendants. See Susan R. Klein et al., Waiving the Criminal Justice System: An Empirical and Constitutional Analysis, 52 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 73, 114 (2015) (noting "that plea agreements are an integral part of the criminal justice system, conserving judicial resources and providing defendants the opportunity to obtain often much-needed reductions in sentences or dismissal of charges in return for a plea and the waivers of all trial rights").
I acknowledge that in the real world, defendants do at times plead guilty to offenses which, in a final reckoning, they did not commit. Typically, there are two reasons why this occurs. One is a strategic decision by the defendant to avoid other, more serious convictions or additional, more severe penalties that would result from going to trial. See, e.g., State v. Ceretti, 871 N.W.2d 88, 89 (Iowa 2015) (noting that the defendant was charged with first-degree murder but pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter, attempted murder, and willful injury causing serious injury). The other  is when the defendant committed a crime to which she or he intended to plead guilty but the wrong crime was charged by mistake. See, e.g., State v. Nall, 894 N.W.2d 514, 525 (Iowa 2017) ("Under these facts, a factual basis may exist for a charge under section 714.1(6) (theft by check), but not under section 714.1(1)."). Neither of these scenarios calls for the drastic change in the law that the majority has announced today.
The majority cites one case from South Dakota and one case from New York before asking, rhetorically, "What kind of system of justice do we have if we permit actually innocent people to remain in prison?" Despite this sloganeering, the fact remains that both cases involved defendants who went to trial. See In re Kaufmann, 245 N.Y. 423, 157 N.E. 730, 730-31 (N.Y. 1927); Engesser v. Young, 2014 SD 81, 856 N.W.2d 471, 473 (S.D. 2014).
Before a defendant pleads guilty, the law protects that defendant in several ways. First, a detailed colloquy is required. See Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.8(2)(b). The defendant is informed he or she is giving up the right to a trial and there will not be a further trial of any kind. Id. r. 2.8(2)(b)(4)-(5). Until today, those were true statements.
Second, the record must show a factual basis for each charge to which the defendant is pleading guilty. See, e.g., Nall, 894 N.W.2d at 525; Rhoades v. State, 848 N.W.2d 22, 33 (Iowa 2014); State v. Gines, 844 N.W.2d 437, 441 (Iowa 2014).
Third, as discussed above, the plea must be voluntary and intelligent, and if counsel was ineffective in some manner that rendered the plea involuntary or unintelligent, that can be raised. See Castro, 795 N.W.2d at 793-94; Carroll, 767 N.W.2d at 642-43.
In my view, these safeguards serve their intended purpose. "Once a defendant has waived his right to a trial by pleading guilty, the State is entitled to expect finality in the conviction." State v. Mann, 602 N.W.2d 785, 789 (Iowa 1999); see also State v. Straw, 709 N.W.2d 128, 138 (Iowa 2006).
While I expect today's decision to lead to a new wave of applications for postconviction relief, and more work for appointed counsel, prosecutors, and the courts, I do not see the need. Why are the legal grounds already established by this court and the legislature for relief from guilty pleas not enough?15  Certainly, the present case—involving a fishy nonrecantation by the victim (and no recantation at all by the eyewitness father)—doesn't demonstrate the need.
The majority underplays the critical distinction between defendants who claim actual innocence following a jury trial conviction and those who claim actual innocence following a guilty plea. Most of the decisions cited by the majority involve a defendant who was convicted after a trial. See Miller v. Comm'r of Corr., 242 Conn. 745,  700 A.2d 1108, 1110-11 (Conn. 1997); People v. Washington, 171 Ill. 2d 475, 665 N.E.2d 1330, 1331, 216 Ill. Dec. 773 (Ill. 1996); State ex rel. Amrine v. Roper, 102 S.W.3d 541, 543-44 (Mo. 2003) (en banc); Montoya v. Ulibarri, 2007- NMSC 035, 142 N.M. 89, 163 P.3d 476, 478 (N.M. 2007); In re Kaufmann, 157 N.E. at 730-31; Engesser, 856 N.W.2d at 473. In Jamison v. State, 410 S.C. 456, 765 S.E.2d 123, 130 (S.C. 2014), the Supreme Court of South Carolina did open the door to actual-innocence claims by persons who had pled guilty but it established a very high burden for them—one the majority characterizes as "too stringent." Also, in People v. Tiger, 149 A.D.3d 86, 48 N.Y.S.3d 685, 700-01 (App. Div. 2017), the court recognized an actual-innocence claim by a defendant who had pled guilty, although New York's highest court has clearly not gone that far, see People v. Plunkett, 19 N.Y.3d 400, 971 N.E.2d 363, 366, 948 N.Y.S.2d 233 (N.Y. 2012) ("Consistently, we have deemed appellate claims challenging what is competently and independently established by a plea forfeited."); see also People v. DePerno, 148 A.D.3d 1463, 51 N.Y.S.3d 641, 643 (App. Div. 2017) (finding by a different department of the appellate division that an actual-innocence claim after a guilty plea was foreclosed). The majority also discusses Ex parte Tuley, 109 S.W.3d 388, 393 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), a 5-4 Texas decision that opened the door to actual-innocence claims following a guilty plea, and People v. Schneider, 25 P.3d 755, 757 (Colo. 2001) (en banc), a Colorado decision that did the same.
Iowa is not alone in giving finality to guilty pleas notwithstanding claims of actual innocence. See, e.g., Williams v. State, 2017 Ark. 313, 530 S.W.3d 844, 846 (Ark. 2017) ("Williams's argument that he is actually innocent of the offense to which he pleaded guilty does not establish a ground for the writ because it constitutes a direct attack on the judgment."); Norris v. State, 896 N.E.2d 1149, 1153 (Ind. 2008) (rejecting an actual innocence claim and stating that "[a] plea of guilty thus forecloses a post-conviction challenge to the facts adjudicated by the trial court's acceptance of the guilty plea and resulting conviction"); Woods v. State, 52 Kan. App. 2d 958, 379 P.3d 1134, 1142 (Kan. Ct. App. 2016) (stating that a claim of actual innocence is "insufficient to override the longstanding rule that a freely and voluntarily entered guilty plea bars a collateral attack on the sufficiency of the evidence").
One should also read the articles cited by the majority. One of the articles is written by a senior federal judge and another by a former federal judge. Jed S. Rakoff, Why Innocent People Plead Guilty, N.Y. Rev. Books (Nov. 20, 2014), www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/11/20/why-innocent-people-plead-guilty/[https://perma.cc/LT8T-XKAV ]; H. Lee Sarokin, Why Do Innocent People Plead Guilty?, Huffington Post (May 29, 2012, 4:39 PM), https://www.huffingtonpost.com/judge-h-lee-sarokin/innocent-people-guilty-pleas_b_1553239.html/[https://perma.cc/6PSQ-6ZW4 ]. As participants in the system, the views of these two authors deserve our consideration. Yet neither of these authors recommends today's solution—i.e., a freestanding claim of innocence as a way to challenge guilty pleas. To the contrary, Judge Rakoff advocates "involving judges in the plea-bargaining process," while Mr. Sarokin insists "[t]he only solution is vigilance by all involved."
Reexamining a guilty plea years after the fact is far different from reviewing a trial. Unlike with a case that actually went to trial, no trial transcript can be relied on if the witnesses no longer are around, have forgotten the events, or no longer are motivated to remember them. See Rhoades, 880 N.W.2d at 449 (acknowledging the difficulty in accurately determining a claim of  actual innocence when there has been a plea bargain and no trial record exists).
Under Maryland law, convicted persons may not petition for a writ of actual innocence if they have pled guilty. Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. § 8-301 (West, Westlaw through ch. 1-4 2018 Reg. Sess.). The Maryland Court of Special Appeals has noted,
Under most circumstances, the facts alleged in a petition for postconviction relief will necessarily, in part, be drawn from the trial record. However, when there was a guilty plea, there is no detailed trial record, no witness testimony, and often there is only a minimal factual investigation on the part of the State and defense counsel. Thus, both the defense's factual quest to establish innocence as well as the State's attempt to refute innocence are hindered by the inherent gaps available in evidence in cases in which the petitioner pled guilty. Petitions stemming from a conviction following a guilty plea should thus be denied.
Yonga v. State, 221 Md. App. 45, 108 A.3d 448, 461 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2015) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Nicholas Phillips, Comment, Innocence and Incarceration: A Comprehensive Review of Maryland's Postconviction DNA Relief Statute and Suggestions for Improvement, 42 U. Balt. L.F. 65, 93-94 (Fall 2011) (footnotes omitted)), aff'd, 446 Md. 183, 130 A.3d 486 (Md. 2016).
Changes in the law intended to benefit defendants can end up harming them. Now that we have allowed guilty pleas to be set aside based on newly discovered evidence, the state has a powerful incentive not to accept such pleas, despite the benefits to defendants discussed above. The advantages of a plea from the state's perspective are that it provides certainty, closure, and finality. See Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 71, 97 S. Ct. 1621, 1627-28, 52 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1977). That is why the state is often willing to bargain down the original charges as part of a deal. Take away those advantages, and more cases may go to trial on more charges. See id. (noting that the advantages of plea negotiations to judges, prosecutors, and defendants "can be secured . . . only if dispositions by guilty plea are accorded a great measure of finality").
 III. Grounding an Actual-Innocence Claim in the Iowa Constitution Is Highly Problematic.
The majority maintains that an actual-innocence claim for those who plead guilty is required by the Iowa Constitution, specifically article I, section 9 and article I, section 17. It is noteworthy that Schmidt barely argues Iowa constitutional law at all and then only in the supplemental brief which we invited.
The majority's constitutional reasoning is thin and, to me, unpersuasive. I begin with article I, section 9, the Iowa due process clause. The majority initially asserts that convicting an actually innocent person violates article I, section 9's constitutional guarantee of substantive due process. According to the majority, it is a matter of substantive due process because the violation consists of the mere fact an innocent person has been convicted.
But the majority can't literally mean that—otherwise there would be no limits on actual-innocence claims. Thus, the majority shifts to the position that innocent people need to have an opportunity to prove they are innocent. That's a matter of procedural due process. Yet our justice system already has many procedures in place to protect innocent people from being convicted. These include the trial, the guilty plea colloquy, the right to counsel, and so forth.
 So what the majority is really saying is that the Iowa due process clause requires one more procedure, i.e., the one devised today, to protect the innocent from being convicted. Why? Why is one more procedure so important as to be of constitutional dimension? The majority does not explain.
Weaker still is the majority's invocation of article I, section 17. This section prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. Yet the issue before this court is not the punishment for Schmidt's crime, but whether Schmidt should have a new opportunity to prove he didn't commit that crime. Unless we are going to ignore the fundamental distinctions among the different rights within our own constitution, article I, section 17 has no bearing on today's case.
 IV. The Majority Opinion Results in Many Unanswered Questions.
Having demonstrated enough self-confidence to tear up an established rule of law, the majority now claims to be too modest to tell us what today's decision means. That's not good enough. One way to test the soundness of a decision is to consider the implications of that decision.
Here are a few questions raised by today's decision.
What does "actual innocence" mean? The majority opinion is unclear and inconsistent concerning the meaning of "actual innocence." At the end the majority states,
[T]he applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that, despite the evidence of guilt supporting the conviction, no reasonable fact finder could convict the applicant of the crimes for which the sentencing court found the applicant guilty in light of all the evidence, including the newly discovered evidence.
Yet earlier, the majority says, "Holding a person who has committed no crime in prison strikes the very essence of the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process." The two statements do not line up. Where are we?
Obviously, at a minimum, the defendant must prove he or she did not commit the crime to which he or she pled guilty. Must the defendant also prove his or her conduct does not amount to a different crime (even a much less serious one)? And what if the defendant pled guilty to several charges at once? Must the defendant establish that none of the incidents involve a crime committed by that defendant?
What is "evidence" at the summary judgment stage? The court directs the parties to provide "other evidence or affidavits" in support of their positions, before the district court rules on the State's motion for summary judgment. What is evidence? The majority indicates that the requirements of rule 1.981 apply. In that event, do minutes of testimony count as evidence, even if the defendant did not previously acknowledge they were true? The special concurrence seems to indicate that the minutes are treated as evidence.
What is "evidence" at the trial stage? If a claim of actual innocence gets past summary judgment, must all evidence used at the postconviction-relief trial comply with the rules of evidence? Again, what's the status of minutes of testimony?
If the normal rules of evidence for summary judgment and trial proceedings do not apply, how does the district court handle the resulting apples-to-oranges comparisons? If minutes of testimony are allowed as evidence, what weight are they given? How are they compared to affidavits and live testimony?
Does a defendant need to do anything other than deny his or her guilt to raise an actual-innocence claim and start the process? According to the court, a freestanding actual-innocence claim can be  brought under Iowa Code section 822.2(1)(a). But if a claim of innocence by itself is enough, the defendant doesn't need a recantation or other allegedly new evidence, unless the three-year time bar has passed. See Iowa Code § 822.3. A mere denial of guilt is enough to get new counsel appointed and get the ball rolling.
What is the role of the defendant's guilty plea counsel? Typically, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel waives the attorney-client privilege. See Iowa R. Prof'l Conduct 32:1.6(b)(5). So, when the defendant claims to have received ineffective assistance in connection with a plea, former counsel can testify about his or her communications with the defendant concerning the plea. These communications may have information bearing on the defendant's actual innocence. Is such testimony now off-limits, since the defendant can challenge the guilty plea without having to argue ineffective assistance of counsel?
What about Alford pleas? An Alford plea "was designed to permit a defendant to make a voluntary and intelligent decision to plead guilty to a crime without admitting participation in the underlying facts which constitute the crime." State v. Klawonn, 609 N.W.2d 515, 520 (Iowa 2000) (citing North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S. Ct. 160, 167-68, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970)). With an Alford plea, the defendant "claim[s] innocence" but makes a "cost-benefit analysis of avoiding the risks associated with a trial." Id. at 520-21. After today, does someone who made an Alford plea now get to raise an actual-innocence claim? That seems strange. After all, nothing has changed. Such a defendant always maintained he or she was innocent. Or are Alford pleas now unconstitutional in light of today's decision?
If the defendant succeeds, can other charges be reinstated? Part of the established remedy when setting aside a guilty plea is to reinstate all charges dismissed as part of any plea bargain. See State v. Weitzel, 905 N.W.2d 397, 411 (Iowa 2017) (allowing the state to "reinstate any charges dismissed in contemplation of a valid plea bargain"); Gines, 844 N.W.2d at 442 ("[W]e must put the State back in the position it was in before making the plea agreement."); see also Ceretti, 871 N.W.2d at 97; State v. Allen, 708 N.W.2d 361, 369 (Iowa 2006). So, if the defendant establishes actual innocence and there was a plea bargain, does the state get to reinstate other charges that were dismissed?
The majority refuses to consider issues like these because it doesn't want to get into the merits of the case. But none of these matters goes to the actual merits. Some of them were discussed in the supplemental briefing invited by this court. If our court is going to change the law, it should clarify the change as much as possible and not leave it to district courts to play a game of twenty questions. In other decisions, we have given "protocols" to our district courts. See, e.g., State v. Harrington, 893 N.W.2d 36, 45-46 (Iowa 2017) (describing a "protocol" to use in the future); State v. Dahl, 874 N.W.2d 348, 353 (Iowa 2016) (same); Fagen v. Grand View Univ., 861 N.W.2d 825, 828 (Iowa 2015) (plurality opinion) (same); State v. Cashen, 789 N.W.2d 400, 403 (Iowa 2010) (same), superseded by statute, 2011 Iowa Acts ch. 8, § 2 (codified at Iowa Code § 622.10).
 V. Conclusion.
From the State's perspective, I am guessing it would have simply preferred to try Schmidt all those years ago. In the long run, I am doubtful today's decision will benefit defendants. More importantly, today's decision needlessly overturns an  established rule of law that was fair to all parties and worked well.
Waterman and Zager, JJ., join this dissent.
