 in part and dissenting in part).
I concur in Division III of the court's opinion. I dissent from Division IV. I believe the record is inadequate to determine what the parties' plea agreement was.
The parties apparently reached a plea agreement. From the record it is unclear whether it involved a joint recommendation of a deferred judgment, which is what defense counsel said in the petition to plead guilty and in open court at the change of plea hearing; or whether the State had the right to make an independent sentencing recommendation, which is what the order entered at the plea hearing stated. I note that the plea hearing commenced at 9:06 a.m. and concluded at 9:12 a.m. on February 26, 2018, whereas the order was efiled at 9:11 a.m. on the 26th. In other words, it appears the court was finalizing the order during the change of plea hearing itself. And they contradict each other.
Defense counsel never objected to the court's order. Moreover, a fairly lengthy sentencing proceeding occurred nearly two months later on April 19. The proceeding took approximately forty minutes of court time, and there was considerable discussion and debate regarding the sentence. Yet defense counsel—while asking for a deferred judgment on behalf of his client—never claimed there was an agreement to jointly recommend a deferred judgment.
Reasonable people can wonder, therefore, what the deal was.
Two possibilities exist here. One is that the parties actually had an agreement to jointly recommend a deferred judgment. In that event, the State breached the plea agreement and it should be enforced.
The other possibility, however, is that the parties' plea agreement did not include a joint sentencing recommendation. In that event, we should not enforce something the parties didn't actually agree to. Instead, because the colloquy on February 26 was defective if that was the agreement, the plea should be set aside.
The majority confuses what is a necessary condition of court approval of a plea agreement (i.e., recital of the plea agreement in open court on the record) with what constitutes the actual agreement. Whatever the parties agree to has to be recited. However, the converse is not always true: whatever a party says in open court is not necessarily the agreement. Something that one party recited but that wasn't actually agreed to should not be controlling. Plea bargains are akin to contracts. Rhoades v. State, 880 N.W.2d 431, 449 (Iowa 2016) ("A plea bargain also may be regarded as a contract where both sides ordinarily obtain a benefit."). Would anyone say it is clear on this record what the parties' contract was?
I would reverse Macke's conviction and sentence and remand for the court to conduct a hearing to determine whether there was an agreement to jointly recommend a deferred judgment. If so, the agreement should be enforced and there should be a resentencing before a different judge on that basis. If not, there was no valid plea and the parties should be restored to their pre-plea positions.
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.
 McDONALD, Justice (dissenting).
Effective July 1, 2019, this court lost the authority to decide a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. See 2019 Iowa Acts ch. 140, § 31 (to be codified at Iowa Code § 814.7 (2020)) (providing "[a]n ineffective assistance of counsel claim . . . shall not be decided on direct appeal from the criminal proceedings"). Nonetheless, in this direct appeal, the majority decides the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel after the effective date of the statute. I respectfully dissent.
I.
Whether a statute applies retrospectively, prospectively, or both is simply a question regarding the correct temporal application of a statute. See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 291, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1524, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (stating this is a "mundane question" regarding the "temporal application of a statute"). The determination of the correct temporal application of a statute is three-part inquiry.
First, the court must determine whether application of a statute is in fact retrospective. Application of a statute is in fact retrospective when the statute applies a new rule, standard, or consequence to a prior act or omission. See Frideres v. Schiltz, 540 N.W.2d 261, 264 (Iowa 1995) ("A law is retroactive if it affects acts or facts which occurred, or rights which accrued, before the law came into force."). The prior act or omission is the event of legal consequence "that the rule regulates." Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 291, 114 S. Ct. at 1524. In other words, the event of legal consequence is the specific conduct regulated in the statute.
Second, if the court determines operation of a statute is in fact retrospective, the court must determine whether the statute should be applied retrospectively. This is straight-forward inquiry. "Our legislature has provided a statutory general rule that determines the applicability of its laws." Frideres, 540 N.W.2d at 264. Iowa Code section 4.5 (2018) provides "[a] statute is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective." In my view, this requires an assessment of statutory text to determine whether there is an express statement making the statute retrospective. End of inquiry.
Third, if the court determines the text of the statute authorizes retrospective application of the statute, the court must then determine whether any other rule of law prohibits retrospective application of the statute. For example, the defendant might argue the retrospective application of a statute violated her right to due process or violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.
II.
At issue is the temporal application of amendments to Iowa Code sections 814.6 and 814.7 enacted in Senate File 589 (the Omnibus Crime Bill). I address each in turn.
A.
Iowa Code section 814.6 governs the criminal defendant's right to appeal. At the time judgment of sentence was entered in this case, section 814.6 provided, with minor exceptions not applicable here, a defendant was authorized to pursue a direct appeal from any final judgment of sentence. See Iowa Code § 814.6(1)(a) ("Right of appeal is granted the defendant from . . . [a] final judgment of sentence . . . ."). The Omnibus Crime Bill changed this provision. The statute now provides, with exceptions not applicable here, a criminal defendant does not have an appeal as a matter of right from judgment of sentence if the judgment of sentence was entered  pursuant to a conviction following a guilty plea. See 2019 Iowa Acts ch. 140, § 28 (to be codified at Iowa Code § 814.6(1)(a)(3) (2020)).
In determining whether this amendment governs the defendant's right to appeal in this case, the first inquiry is whether application of the amendment is in fact retrospective. It seems clear to me it is. The event of legal consequence is the entry of judgment of sentence. Judgment of sentence was entered in April 2018. The defendant timely appealed as a matter of right from the entry of judgment of sentence. The application of the amendment to an event of consequence antedating the effective date of the amendment is in fact a retrospective application of the statute.
Having concluded the application of the amendment to this case is in fact retrospective, the second inquiry is whether the legislature authorized retrospective application of the statute. See Iowa Code § 4.5 (2018). Here, there is no statutory language authorizing the retrospective application of the statute. Thus, the statute operates only prospectively and cannot change the legal consequence of the entry of judgment and sentence. See id. Because the text of the statute does not provide for retrospective application, there is no need to proceed to the third step of the test. I thus concur in the majority's holding that the defendant can pursue this appeal as a matter of right.
B.
Iowa Code section 814.7 governs the presentation and disposition of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. At the time the defendant filed her notice of appeal in this case, the Code authorized the defendant to present a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iowa Code § 814.7(2) ("A party may, but is not required to, raise an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal from the criminal proceedings . . . ."). The Code also authorized this court to "decide the claim" or "preserve the claim for determination" in postconviction-relief proceedings. Id. § 814.7(3). The Omnibus Crime Bill changed this provision. The amendment restricted this court's authority to decide claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, providing "the claim shall not be decided on direct appeal from the criminal proceedings." 2019 Iowa Acts ch. 140, § 31 (to be codified at Iowa Code § 814.7 (2020)).
In determining whether this amendment governs the defendant's right to bring this claim in this case, the first inquiry is whether application of the amendment is in fact retrospective. With respect to this amendment, the event of legal consequence is this court's exercise of judicial power—specifically, this court's authority to decide a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. As Justice Scalia explained in Landgraf, applying a statute to prevent the exercise of judicial power after the effective date of a statute is in fact a prospective application of a statute:
Our jurisdiction cases are explained, I think, by the fact that the purpose of provisions conferring or eliminating jurisdiction is to permit or forbid the exercise of judicial power—so that the relevant event for retroactivity purposes is the moment at which that power is sought to be exercised. Thus, applying a jurisdiction-eliminating statute to undo past judicial action would be applying it retroactively; but applying it to prevent any judicial action after the statute takes effect is applying it prospectively.
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 293, 114 S. Ct. at 1525.
While this case does not involve the court's jurisdiction, it does involve the  court's authority to exercise judicial power. Thus, properly understood, application of the amendment is not in fact a retrospective application of the statute. Instead, it is a prospective application of the statute to this court's exercise of judicial power occurring after the effective date of the amendment. See Republic Nat'l Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U.S. 80, 100, 113 S. Ct. 554, 565, 121 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) ("But not every application of a new statute to a pending case will produce a 'retroactive effect.' '[W]hether a particular application is retroactive' will 'depen[d] upon what one considers to be the determinative event by which retroactivity or prospectivity is to be calculated.'" (alterations in original) (quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 857-58, 857 n.3, 110 S. Ct. 1570, 1587-88, 1588 n.3, 108 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment))); State v. Blank, 131 Wn.2d 230, 930 P.2d 1213, 1223 (Wash. 1997) (en banc) ("A statute operates prospectively when the precipitating event for [its] application . . . occurs after the effective date of the statute . . . ." (alterations in original) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. v. Wash. Life & Disability Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 83 Wn.2d 523, 520 P.2d 162, 170 (Wash. 1974) (en banc))). Because this amendment does not in fact operate retrospectively, there is no need to analyze the question under the second and third parts of the test.
The majority opinion's conclusion that James v. State, 479 N.W.2d 287 (Iowa 1991), precludes application of the amendment to section 814.7 is a misreading of James. At issue in James was whether the applicants had the right to appeal from prison disciplinary rulings. See id. at 290. "The statute controlling appeals from prison disciplinary rulings which was in effect on that date provided for a right of direct appeal." Id. The court held "[b]ecause statutes controlling appeals are those that were in effect at the time the judgment or order appealed from was rendered," the applicants had the right to appeal. Id. James was limited to the question of whether the applicants had the ability to pursue an appeal as a matter of right. The event of legal consequence in that case was the entry of the rulings in the prison disciplinary cases. There is nothing in James that addresses the question presented in this case—what statute controls the exercise of judicial power at the time the power is exercised. James is simply inapplicable to the question regarding the correct temporal application of the amendment to section 814.7.
Contrary to the majority's interpretation of James, the general rule is that statutes eliminating or restricting the exercise of judicial power after the date of enactment do not raise concerns regarding retroactivity. See, e.g., St. Cyr v. INS, 229 F.3d 406, 420 (2d Cir. 2000), aff'd, 533 U.S. 289, 290-91, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 2274-75, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2001) ("It is true that a change in law that 'speak[s] to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties' may be applied in a case without raising concerns that it is impermissibly retroactive." (alteration in original) (quoting Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 274, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1502, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994) (majority opinion))); Turkhan v. Perryman, 188 F.3d 814, 826 (7th Cir. 1999) (stating present law applies because it "speak[s] to the power of the court" (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 274, 114 S. Ct. at 1502)); In re Resolution Tr. Corp., 888 F.2d 57, 58 (8th Cir. 1989) ("[T]he general rule is otherwise with respect to new enactments changing procedural or jurisdictional rules. If a case is still pending when the new statute is passed, new procedural or jurisdictional rules will usually be applied to it."); Henry  v. Ashcroft, 175 F. Supp. 2d 688, 693 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (stating that statutes "that 'speak to the power of the court' . . . generally do not raise concerns about retroactivity" (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 274, 114 S. Ct. at 1502)); DeGroot v. DeGroot, 939 A.2d 664, 670 n.5 (D.C. 2008) (stating "a court may apply new laws to pending cases when those laws 'speak to the power of the court'" (quoting Coto v. Citibank FSB, 912 A.2d 562, 566 n.4 (D.C. 2006)); State v. Barren, 128 Nev. 337, 279 P.3d 182, 185 (Nev. 2012) (stating present law governs and that "a retroactivity analysis is unnecessary because [it] is a jurisdictional statute"); Univ. of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. at Dallas v. Estate of Arancibia ex rel. Vasquez-Arancibia, 324 S.W.3d 544, 548 (Tex. 2010) (stating that statutes that speak to the power of the court "may be applied to cases pending at the time of enactment").
Because the presumption against the retrospective application of a statute cannot work to bar the prospective application of a statute affecting this court's authority, I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to resolve the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in this direct appeal. The amendment to the statute clearly prohibits this exercise of judicial authority after July 1, 2019. I would follow the plain language of the statute and preserve the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for postconviction-relief proceedings.
III.
The three-part test set forth and applied above is not explicitly set forth in our caselaw. However, our caselaw in this area is a Rorschach test of immaterial distinctions, unhelpful declarations, and result-oriented decisions. The majority opinion does its best to defend the old doctrine, but when the presumption against the retrospective application of a statute can be used to bar the prospective application of a statute, it is time to reconsider the doctrine.
The primary deficiency in our caselaw (and the majority opinion) is it ignores the initial inquiry of whether a statute is in fact retrospective. Instead of creating workable doctrine and corresponding vocabulary to resolve the threshold question of when the operation of statute is in fact retrospective, our caselaw has instead substituted a complex taxonomy and corresponding rules to determine when a statute should be applied retrospectively. Except these are wholly separate questions; substituting one for the other merely confuses the issues. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 291-92, 114 S. Ct. at 1524 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) ("The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects 'vested rights,' or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.").
In addition to confusing the issues, the taxonomy and rules are opaque and largely unworkable in any meaningful sense. Our cases have identified at least five different categories of statutes: remedial, procedural, substantive, curative, and emergency. See Iowa Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity v. State, 763 N.W.2d 250, 266 (Iowa 2009) ("In the absence of a legislative declaration that the statute applies retrospectively, the second step of the analysis is to determine whether the statute is procedural, remedial, or substantive."); Bd. of Trs. of Mun. Fire & Police Ret. Sys. v. City of West Des Moines, 587 N.W.2d 227, 230 n.4 (Iowa 1998) ("We have also determined curative legislation or emergency legislation may be given retrospective application."). Depending upon the categorization of the statute, our caselaw provides different rules, exceptions, and exceptions to exceptions  that govern the temporal application of the statute.
Take, for example, remedial statutes. "A remedial statute intends to correct 'existing law or redress an existing grievance.'" Iowa Beta Chapter, 763 N.W.2d at 266 (quoting Baldwin v. City of Waterloo, 372 N.W.2d 486, 491 (Iowa 1985)). A remedial statute is one which "regulates conduct for the public good." Iowa Comprehensive Petrol. Underground Storage Tank Fund Bd. v. Shell Oil Co., 606 N.W.2d 370, 375 (Iowa 2000).
[It] affords a private remedy to a person injured by a wrongful act, corrects an existing law or redresses an existing grievance, gives a party a mode of remedy for a wrong where none or a different remedy existed, or remedies defects in the common law and in civil jurisprudence generally.
Bd. of Trs. of Mun. Fire & Police Ret. Sys., 587 N.W.2d at 231. Our caselaw sets forth "a three-part test to determine" whether the legislature intended retrospective or prospective application of a remedial statute. Anderson Fin. Servs., LLC v. Miller, 769 N.W.2d 575, 579 (Iowa 2009); Emmet Cty. State Bank v. Reutter, 439 N.W.2d 651, 654 (Iowa 1989).
First, we look to the language of the new legislation; second, we consider the evil to be remedied; and third, we consider whether there was any previously existing statute governing or limiting the mischief which the new legislation was intended to remedy.
Iowa Comprehensive Petrol., 606 N.W.2d at 375 (quoting Emmet Cty. State Bank, 439 N.W.2d at 651). Depending upon how the court assesses those three factors, our cases generally allow retrospective application of a remedial statute. See Iowa Beta Chapter, 763 N.W.2d at 267 ("[W]e do allow a statute to apply retrospectively when the statute provides an additional remedy to an already existing remedy or provides a remedy for an already existing loss . . . ."). Except if the remedial statute eliminates a remedy. See id. ("[W]e have refused to apply a statute retrospectively when the statute eliminates or limits a remedy."). In that case, our caselaw simply reclassifies as substantive what it had previously classified as "procedural" or "remedial." Groesbeck v. Napier, 275 N.W.2d 388, 390-91 (Iowa 1979) (en banc) (classifying a statute as substantive because it eliminated a remedy). Why does the reclassification matter? Because substantive statutes are not applied retrospectively. See Vinson v. Linn-Mar Cmty. Sch. Dist., 360 N.W.2d 108, 121 (Iowa 1984) (holding a statute was substantive because it took away a right of recovery and holding the statute thus could not be applied retrospectively).
I need not discuss any of the other categories or corresponding rules to flesh out the issue. The rules governing the temporal application of the additional categories of statutes are equally opaque. The main point here is the categorical scheme is subject to numerous, apparent shortcomings.
First, the categorical scheme is contrary to section 4.5 of the Code, which provides a statute shall have prospective operation only unless the legislature expressly provides to the contrary. Nowhere does the Code provide for the categorical scheme set forth in our caselaw.
Second, the categorical scheme is in tension with our caselaw, which provides legislative intent controls. See, e.g., Dindinger v. Allsteel, Inc., 860 N.W.2d 557, 563 (Iowa 2015) ("It is well established that a statute is presumed to be prospective only unless expressly made retrospective." (quoting Anderson Fin. Servs., 769 N.W.2d at 578)); Iowa Comprehensive Petrol., 606 N.W.2d at 375 ("Absent an expressed indication to  the contrary, statutes are generally presumed to apply prospectively."); Emmet Cty. State Bank, 439 N.W.2d at 654 ("The determination instead boils down to whether the legislature intended to give the amendment here retrospective or prospective application."); Barad v. Jefferson County, 178 N.W.2d 376, 378 (Iowa 1970) ("The question of retrospectivity is one of legislative intent. Where the legislature has clearly expressed its intent we do not resort to rules of statutory construction." (citation omitted)).
Third, our categorical approach is a rhetorical device to justify results-oriented decisions rather than an analytical device to actually decide cases. The classification of any statute as remedial, procedural, substantive, curative, or emergency is largely guesswork. While there might be straight-forward cases at either end of the spectrum, for the great number of cases, the classification is likely to turn on the court's whim. For example, as noted above, our cases specifically state that a remedial statute should be reclassified as a substantive statute if the statute eliminates a remedy. That exception seems wholly arbitrary to me. We have an adversarial legal system. Any statute that works a debit in the ledger of one party puts a credit in the ledger of the adverse party. It is thus unclear to me why the elimination of a remedy makes a remedial statute substantive but the addition of a remedy keeps a remedial statute remedial. "The seemingly random exceptions to the Court's 'vested rights' (substance-vs.-procedure) criterion must be made, I suggest, because that criterion is fundamentally wrong." Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 291, 114 S. Ct. at 1524.
Because of the deficiencies in our existing caselaw, I would move away from the categorical distinctions and instead adopt the three-part test set forth in this opinion.
IV.
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
