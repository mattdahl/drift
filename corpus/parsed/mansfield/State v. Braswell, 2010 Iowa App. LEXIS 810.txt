I respectfully dissent. The critical question is whether Braswell's arrest preceded the State's request for the chemical test by more than two hours. I agree with my colleagues that the request came between 4:47 and 4:50 a.m. However, I cannot agree that the defendant Braswell was under arrest at 2:44 a.m. on February 28, 2009, when he possibly entered Trooper Salesberry's car. As discussed below, I think it is unclear whether Braswell even entered Salesberry's car prior to 2:54 a.m., when he was transported in the front of Salesberry's car to the West Des Moines police station. The DVD does not show where Salesberry and Braswell went at 2:44 a.m., just that Braswell was trailing Salesberry on foot outside the Kum & Go. However, regardless of how this factual point is resolved, Braswell was not arrested at 2:44 a.m. My colleagues have erroneously transformed a non-custodial encounter into a full-blown arrest.
Iowa State Police Trooper Christensen was assigned to Post Two, which covers various counties south of Polk County and north of the Missouri border. Early on the wintry morning of February 28, he was dispatched to assist a stranded motorist along I-35 several miles south of the Polk County line. The motorist was on crutches and had only one leg, and his car needed antifreeze. Christensen decided to drive him to the nearest Kum & Go, located in West Des Moines at I-35 and Mills Civic Parkway. Christensen planned to drive this motorist back to his car after he purchased antifreeze.
Upon arriving at the Kum & Go, Christensen was informed by the night manager that two people (a male and a female) were passed out in a black Mercedes in the parking lot with the engine running and the lights on. Shortly before 2:35 a.m., Christensen approached the car. After repeated knocking, he woke the driver, later identified as John Braswell. Christensen noticed Braswell had an extremely strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, as well as bloodshot and watery eyes. He asked for identification. Seemingly confused, Braswell produced first a credit card and then his deputy sheriff's badge. Eventually, Braswell was able to provide his driver's license and registration. At 2:36 a.m. Christensen asked Braswell to "stand by" and went back to his patrol car. Christensen then radioed for assistance, explaining that he was already dealing with a "1046" (a driver's request for assistance) and needed help on "another violation."
While waiting for the other officer to arrive, Christensen returned to Braswell's car. Christensen asked Braswell how much he had had to drink. Braswell answered, "Enough not to drive." 7  The dialogue then continued:
CHRISTENSEN: All right. Do you have a gun in the car?
BRASWELL: No.
CHRISTENSEN: All right. All right. Well, I got a guy in there with me now [the stranded motorist] who I got to deal with. So you're going to need to stand by for a few minutes.
BRASWELL: What? But I ain't driving.
CHRISTENSEN: Well, we haven't got that far yet. I still got to deal with you. Where do you work? You work the street or the jail or what?
BRASWELL: Civil division.
CHRISTENSEN: Civil division. All right. Why don't you come inside the Kum & Go and talk to me? That way you won't get cold. I won't get cold, and we can talk to you in there.
BRASWELL: All right.
Thus, at 2:40 a.m. Braswell and Christensen entered the Kum & Go. Christensen walked in first, allowing Braswell to follow him by a few paces.
Additional conversation occurred inside the Kum & Go. When Christensen asked Braswell why he had not had his female companion drive, Braswell answered he was "stubborn."
At 2:43 a.m. State Trooper Salesberry, who works for Troop One based in Polk County, arrived at the Kum & Go parking lot. A dispatcher, Robert Johannesen, was also riding in Salesberry's car. Christensen noticed the car's arrival and asked Braswell to "just hang out." Christensen then left the store to go outside and speak with Salesberry. Christensen explained the situation to Salesberry and asked Salesberry to "process" Braswell. Salesberry said he would "take care of it" and that Christensen could go. Christensen responded, "I kind of want to see what's going to happen here."
Thus, at 2:44 a.m. Christensen and Salesberry walked into the Kum & Go together. Christensen explained to Braswell:
CHRISTENSEN: Mr. Braswell, come here. Here's what's going to happen. I'm from a post down south.
BRASWELL: Okay.
CHRISTENSEN: This is a post one trooper. He works Polk County.
When I walked up to your car, your engine was running. Your lights were on. The manager was concerned about this. So I checked on you. You rolled the window down, and I told you right away [inaudible]. Your eyes were bloodshot and watery, speech was slurred.
So I called him in to deal with you. That's where we are. All right?
BRASWELL: Okay.
At that point, Salesberry can be seen on the DVD walking out of the Kum & Go toward his vehicle. Braswell can be seen following Salesberry about ten feet behind.
For the next three or four minutes, Christensen interviewed the Kum & Go night manager inside the store while Salesberry and Braswell talked separately. Since the microphone was on Christensen, not Salesberry, there is no recording of what Salesberry and Braswell discussed. Also, because the camera inside Christensen's car was aimed at the Kum & Go, it is not clear where Salesberry and Braswell spoke. My colleagues assume it was in Salesberry's car, but the record does not confirm this.
It is true, as my colleagues point out, that Christensen testified "yes" when asked by Braswell's attorney to confirm that "Trooper Salesberry took Mr. Braswell and put him in his car." However, from the DVD, it is apparent that Christensen stayed inside the Kum & Go and likely would not have known where Salesberry and Braswell went to talk. Notably, Dispatcher Christensen, Salesberry's passenger, testified that he observed Braswell on two occasions--first, when he saw Braswell inside the Kum & Go, and, second, "[i]n the vehicle when we were doing the transport, when he got in, I could immediately smell an odor of an alcoholic beverage." This indicates Braswell did not get into Salesberry's car until he was being taken to the West Des Moines police station, approximately ten minutes later.
At 2:48 a.m. Salesberry walked back into the Kum & Go, leaving Braswell (wherever he was) behind. Salesberry approached Christensen, and the two troopers had a private conversation, only the last part of which is audible on the recording.
At the suppression hearing, both Salesberry and Christensen testified that Salesberry told Christensen in the inaudible portion of the conversation he was not going to process Braswell because of a personal "conflict." Thereafter, on the audible portion of the recording, Christensen can be heard saying that he would take over the processing. He stated to Salesberry, "It's an OWI. It's an indictable offense." Salesberry said he understood. Christensen also asked Salesberry if he had done field sobriety on Braswell, and Salesberry indicated he had not, responding, "I mainly talked to her [Braswell's companion] and talked to him [Braswell]." 8  Christensen said he would perform field sobriety in the Kum & Go, unless he could do it at the West Des Moines Police Department. Salesberry indicated "they got a space there" and agreed to lead the way to the police department, about a mile or a mile and a half away. According to his later trial testimony, Salesberry loaded Braswell into his patrol car at that point. 9  Johannesen recalled that Braswell rode up front with Salesberry to the police station while Johannesen himself rode in the back seat.
At 2:54 a.m. the two cars headed toward the West Des Moines police station. Christensen still had the stranded motorist in his car, which followed Salesberry's. At 2:56 a.m., the cars arrived at the police station. The stranded motorist was transferred to Salesberry's car. Christensen went into the police station with Braswell. Braswell started walking from the lobby area into the bathroom, and Christensen followed him saying, "You can't go in there. I may want urine as a test from you." Braswell kept going until Christensen grabbed his arm and pushed him back into the lobby. One of the West Des Moines police officers time-stamped a punch card saying that Christensen and Braswell had arrived at 2:58 a.m.
At 3:02 a.m. Braswell refused to perform the preliminary field sobriety tests, and at 3:10 a.m. he was given his Miranda rights. He was never specifically told he was arrested. During his time in the police station, Braswell repeatedly asked officers for "professional courtesy" and to "help me out," but his requests were denied. He also asked to place, and did place, various phone calls. Christensen later testified that Braswell appeared to be "stalling," an impression that is confirmed by the transcript of the police station recording.
It is not disputed that Christensen read the implied consent form to Braswell at 4:47/4:48 a.m. and that Braswell received it no later than 4:50 a.m. Christensen allowed Braswell to defer making a decision on chemical testing until his attorney arrived in the police station. After privately consulting his attorney, Christensen consented to the chemical test, and the test result of .137 occurred at 5:32 a.m.
The fighting issue in this case is whether the chemical test was offered to Braswell within two hours of his arrest. See Iowa Code ยง 321J.6(2) ("If the peace officer fails to offer a test within two hours after the preliminary screening test is administered or refused or the arrest is made, whichever occurs first, a test is not required, and there shall be no revocation under section 321J.9."). I believe it was. Our legislature has defined "arrest" as "the taking of a person into custody when and in the manner authorized by law, including restraint of the person or that person's submission to custody." Iowa Code ยง 804.5. At the very earliest, Braswell could not have been considered "arrested" until Trooper Salesberry "loaded" him into the front of his patrol car and took him to the police station at 2:54 a.m. The request for the chemical test came no later than 4:50 a.m., which was within two hours.
To have a valid argument for suppression of the breath test results, Braswell must establish he was under arrest at 2:44 a.m. when he followed Trooper Salesberry on foot out of the Kum & Go and (according to my colleagues) to his patrol car. This argument cannot be sustained. At that point the OWI was still in an investigatory stage. No field tests had been performed. Braswell was not under restraint of any kind. He is seen on the video walking out of the store well behind Salesberry. No one had used the word "arrest"; Christensen told Braswell in Salesberry's presence that Salesberry was simply going to "deal with you." The record does not reflect exactly what Salesberry and Braswell discussed, or where they talked, but at the conclusion of their conversation Salesberry left Braswell behind, reentered the Kum & Go, and told Christensen he did not want to process the case because of a "conflict." In sum, as of 2:44 a.m., we have only an investigation in progress, not an arrest.
My colleagues, I believe mistakenly, rely on three points to conclude Braswell was under arrest as of 2:44 a.m. First, they assert he was not "free to leave." Second, they assert Christensen had already concluded Braswell was intoxicated at that point and intended to arrest him. Third, they focus on Christensen's change of testimony regarding his understanding of the legal definition of arrest.
Turning to the first point, any person who has been subjected to a traffic stop is not free to leave. Nevertheless, we have long drawn a clear demarcation between a traffic stop and an arrest. What happened here, at least until Braswell was taken to the police station, was just a traffic stop. Braswell was asked politely to "stand by," "hang out," etc. for a brief period of about fifteen minutes while a preliminary OWI investigation proceeded, delayed partly by Christensen's need to deal with another matter and partly by Salesberry's reluctance to get involved in a matter involving another law enforcement officer. The majority's reliance on State v. Dennison, 571 N.W.2d 492 (Iowa 1997), is puzzling to me, because Dennison indicates that "an individual's detention by an officer for the purposes of performing field sobriety tests does not rise to the level of custody, but is merely detention for investigative purposes." Dennison, 571 N.W.2d at 495. As in Dennison, we have here only "detention for investigative purposes." I do not believe the majority opinion in this case squares with Dennison.
Nor is it relevant that by 2:44 a.m. Trooper Christensen may have already reached a subjective conclusion that Braswell had been operating his vehicle while intoxicated and would need to be taken into custody. The test of whether a person has been arrested is an objective one.
To determine if a suspect is in custody we look to whether the suspect was formally arrested or whether the suspect's freedom of movement was restricted to such a degree to be associated with a formal arrest . . . . A custody determination depends on objective circumstances, not the subjective belief of the officers or the defendant.
State v. Bogan, 774 N.W.2d 676, 680 (Iowa 2009); see also State v. Miranda, 672 N.W.2d 753, 759 (Iowa 2003); State v. Countryman, 572 N.W.2d 553, 558 (Iowa 1997). What Christensen believed or expected to happen as he was dealing with Braswell is beside the point.
For the same reasons, I put little stock in Christensen's affirmative response to a long, leading deposition question that "for all practical purposes when Mr. Braswell was with Trooper Salesberry he was basically under arrest." Again, what matters is not what Christensen may have believed, but what the objective circumstances were. The DVD shows clearly a non-arrest situation. Moreover, Christensen retracted this deposition answer at the suppression hearing, explaining quite simply, "I have since learned that legally he wasn't under arrest."
If subjective beliefs matter, my colleagues fail to explain why we should focus only on Christensen's subjective beliefs as opposed to those of Salesberry, who supposedly took Braswell into custody at 2:44 a.m. Yet Salesberry testified as follows:
Q. Did you see him [Christensen] do anything that from your point of view would indicate to you that the Defendant was under arrest? A. No.
Q. Did you place the Defendant under arrest? A. No, I did not.
. . . .
Q. Did you do anything that would give you grounds to believe that he was under arrest? A. I did nothing to arrest him, no.
I agree with my colleagues that the limits on closing argument were appropriate. The remaining appellate issues raised by Braswell and not discussed in the majority opinion are insubstantial. I would affirm.
