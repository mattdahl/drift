 specially).
I agree that Jose Lopez's conviction for indecent exposure should be reversed. The statute criminalizes only the act of exposing oneself, not an image of oneself. However, I find the majority's otherwise insightful analysis incomplete, because it is strictly limited to the facts of the case. The majority doesn't tell us where Iowa Code section 709.9 ultimately draws the line between criminal and noncriminal conduct. Therefore, while I join the court's opinion, I would go further and adopt a standard to govern future cases. When we are asked to interpret a criminal statute, our answer to that question should give fair notice of the conduct that the statute prohibits. See State v. Hearn, 797 N.W.2d 577, 585 (Iowa 2011) (discussing principles of statutory construction).
I think we can use an existing definition from another body of law to achieve that goal here. When a person transmits video or photos that have previously been "fixed in any tangible medium of expression," see 17 U.S.C. ยง 102(a) (2012), that person is exposing an image rather than exposing himself or herself. Therefore, Iowa Code section 709.9 does not cover that conduct. See Iowa Code ยง 709.9 (2015) (defining indecent exposure in part as when a person "exposes the person's genitals or pubes to another not the person's spouse").
By this standard, Lopez's crude act of texting a previously taken photo of his erect penis did not amount to indecent exposure. However, this legal standard also makes it clear that a person can be convicted of indecent exposure if he or she intentionally exposes himself or herself to another via a real-time electronic connection, such as a security camera, FaceTime, or Skype. See State v. Jorgensen, 758 N.W.2d 830, 834 n.3 (Iowa 2008) (not deciding this issue). In that case, what is being transmitted is not a previously recorded image.
For the foregoing reasons, I join in the court's opinion but also specially concur.
Cady, C.J., joins this special concurrence.
