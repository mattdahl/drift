I respectfully dissent because I believe there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict.
The defendant, Anthony Herron, was Chastity Howard's boyfriend. There was no evidence that any adult lived in the apartment other than Herron and Howard. Herron admitted he had been living with Howard in the apartment for three or four weeks and had a sexual relationship with her.
A large quantity of crack cocaine was found hidden in Howard's bedroom. Howard denied it was hers. The cocaine was moist, suggesting it had been a recent cook. The digital scales found inside the bedroom dresser had chunks on them, indicating they had recently been used to weigh crack cocaine that was still damp.
On his person, Herron had $1368 in cash, crumpled up in different pockets on his person. The cash included eight fifty-dollar bills and thirty-four twenty-dollar bills. The trial testimony also indicated that twenty-dollar rocks are the most common quantity of crack cocaine sold, with fifty-dollar rocks being the second most common quantity. When questioned, Herron claimed he had earned the cash working at two businesses. Both businesses denied having employed him. Herron also said he hid his cash from time to time in Howard's bedroom.
When the officers arrived, the only persons present in the apartment were Howard, Herron, and Javis Woodson, the shooting victim. Woodson did not live in the apartment; he was dating a woman who lived across the street. He had only loose change in his pants. Herron claimed he had transported Woodson to Howard's apartment himself after Woodson had been shot.
I agree with my colleagues' recitation of the law. But I believe the foregoing facts are sufficient to sustain Herron's conviction for possession with intent to deliver crack cocaine.
