I respectfully dissent, because I believe the majority and the district court incorrectly applied the law in this case. In determining what is the "nearest feasible route," see Iowa Code ยง 6A.4(2), the district court should consider the impact of the proposed roadway on the servient estate. Common sense dictates that this should be part of the "feasibility" inquiry. Because the district court essentially declined to consider such evidence, and focused only on which roadway would be cheaper to build and presents fewer engineering issues, I would reverse and remand.
The choice in this case was between Route 6, which cuts through the middle of the Green Brothers' 292-acre dairy farm, and Route 8, which straddles the edge of that farm and otherwise goes through undeveloped land. The Green Brothers have owned and operated their dairy farm for twenty-seven years. They maintain approximately seventy-five dairy cows. The cows use the entire property, although the farm buildings and the only water source are located at the southern end. Additionally, the Green Brothers grow corn and hay on the property.
There was substantial evidence that if Route 6 were chosen, the Green Brothers would have to fence the condemned roadway. There would be a dramatic impact on the value of their land. One of their experts estimated a $ 190,000 reduction in value; the other estimated a $ 180,000 reduction in value. The divided land would, among other things, be much less convenient to use. In addition, the Green Brothers would incur additional costs to install electricity and a well in the northern half of the property.
Wilderness Ridge acquired its seventy-five acres of landlocked wilderness land in 2006 for $ 130,000. It wants to have the ability to drive four-wheel drive vehicles and logging trucks across the Green Brothers' farm. It intends to use its seventy-five acres for recreational hunting, and potentially other purposes in the future.
In short, there was substantial evidence that Route 6 would do more harm to the Green Brothers' farm than the landlocked parcel that it seeks to benefit is presently worth.
In picking Route 6 over Route 8, the district court disregarded all this evidence. Instead, it basically relied on the testimony of Wilderness Ridge's expert that Route 8 would be cheaper to build and is somewhat "flatter" and thus preferable from an engineering standpoint.
Iowa Code section 6A.4(2) is an extraordinary law. It allows one private property owner to take another private property owner's land. While such laws exist in a number of jurisdictions, they are understandably not favored. Kelly v. Panther Creek Plantation, L.L.C., 934 So.2d 1049, 1055-56 (Ala. 2006) (quoting earlier case to the effect that the statute giving a landlocked owner the right to condemn a way of necessity over the lands of a stranger "is not a favored statute, . . . [w]e are taking the property of one man and giving it to another"); Brown v. McAnally, 97 Wn.2d 360, 644 P.2d 1153, 1160 (Wash. 1982) ("We have held, and continue to hold, that the statute which gives a landlocked owner a way of necessity over lands of a stranger is not favored in law and thus must be construed strictly."); see also Curtman v. Piezuch, 494 S.W.2d 668, 671 (Mo. Ct. App. 1973) (same); McGinnis v. McCarter, 940 A.2d 581, 584 (Pa. Cmwlth. Ct. 2008) (same); Barge v. Sadler, 70 S.W.3d 683, 688 (Tenn. 2002) (same).
When applying section 6A.4(2), courts are supposed to select the "nearest feasible route" that meets certain other criteria. I believe the word "feasible" incorporates consideration of the impact of the route on the servient estate. I reach this conclusion for several reasons.
First, I take the word "feasible" to mean "practical." But how can you decide whether a roadway is practical if you disregard its effects on the property it is crossing?
Second, statutory construction should reach a just and reasonable result. Iowa Code ยง 4.4(3). I believe it is neither just nor reasonable to hold that someone who acquires undeveloped property, knowing it is landlocked, should be entitled to the access route across another's property that is most convenient for them from an engineering and construction cost perspective, regardless of its impact on the other property owner.
Third, I believe the supreme court's decision in Owens v. Brownlie, 610 N.W.2d 860 (Iowa 2000), supports this construction. I agree Owens technically involves a slightly different issue. The question presented there was when a necessity exists to condemn an access road at all. In determining this question, the court indicates (twice) that it "may be appropriate to also consider the value of the land sought to be condemned [for the access road]." Id. at 868. Yet if one can consider the value of the land that would be condemned in determining the right to an access road, logic dictates that you can consider the value of the land that would be condemned in determining the specific route of that road.
Fourth, other jurisdictions have followed this approach. See, e.g., Brothers v. Holloway, 692 So.2d 845, 848 (Ala. Civ. App. 1997) ("we agree with the condemnees' position that their convenience was a material consideration for the trial court"); West v. Hinksmon, 857 P.2d 483, 487 (Colo. Ct. App. 1992) ("the condemnee should be permitted, upon proper proof, to show that an acceptable alternative route across condemnee's property exists which would be less damaging than that proposed by condemnor"). In Wagle v. Williamson, 61 Wn. App. 474, 810 P.2d 1372, 1376-77 (Wash. Ct. App. 1991), the court interpreted Washington's admittedly different statute and held that the trial court erred in granting an access easement that--like Route 6 here--bisected the adjacent property owner's land. The court added, "[T]he opinion of the burdened landowner, as to whether a specific way of necessity imposes a greater burden than would an alternative route, must be given considerable weight." Id. at 1376.
The only counterargument raised by Wilderness Ridge is that the actual condemnation damages will be determined in a separate proceeding pursuant to chapter 6B. But this argument, in my view, misses the point. The fact that damages are fixed in another proceeding in no way diminishes the importance of selecting the most "feasible" route from everyone's perspective (not just that of the landlocked property owner) in the first place. Once the parties arrive at the damages proceeding, it is too late to do anything about route selection. There is nothing inconsistent in allowing the district court to take into account the burden of a route on the servient estate at the section 6A.4(2) phase; indeed, Owens already dictates such an approach to some extent, while reserving the final damages award to the chapter 6B phase.
I would be prepared to accept the district court's finding that Dudley Lane is not an actual road at this point, regardless of the fact that it may appear in the ordinance books. However, resolving that issue in favor of Wilderness Ridge means only that Route 8 is 420 feet longer than Route 6. It does not establish which path is the "nearest feasible route" to an existing public road, because there is substantial evidence that Route 6 would have a serious adverse impact on the Green Brothers' dairy farm. Accordingly, I would reverse and remand for the district court to make further factual findings, using the legal standard set forth above.
