 specially)
If I were free to do so, I would hold that voluntary absence is a lesser-included offense of escape. Once a person has escaped from a correctional facility, he or she is clearly absent from a place where he or she is required to be. Thus, I do not believe it is possible to commit the offense of escape as defined in Iowa Code section 719.4(1) without also committing the offense of voluntary absence as set forth in section 719.4(3). I agree with my colleagues, however, that State v. Beeson, 569 N.W.2d 107 (Iowa 1997), states otherwise and controls this case. See id. at 112 ("[V]oluntary absence is not a lesser-included offense of escape."). I also agree with the State that the evidence Campbell committed the offense of escape is strong. Accordingly, I specially concur.
