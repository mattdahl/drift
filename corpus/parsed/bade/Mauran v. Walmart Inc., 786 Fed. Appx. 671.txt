, dissenting in part.
I respectfully dissent from the conclusion in part III that the district court abused its discretion in awarding costs to Walmart. The district court properly applied Rule 54(d)(1), considered Mauran's arguments against awarding costs, and did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Mauran had not rebutted the presumption for awarding costs to the prevailing party. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1); Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, 335 F.3d 932, 944-45 (9th Cir. 2003). I would affirm the award of costs.
