, dissenting in part.
I respectfully dissent from the conclusion in section 3 that the district court erred with respect to Rogers's purported renewed request for an academic schedule change in February 2015. In my view, Rogers's communications to Dr. Thrush did not request a change to her schedule as an accommodation for her disability. Rogers merely sought to discuss her schedule, among multiple other topics, with Dr. Thrush. And even if Rogers did request a schedule change as a disability accommodation from Dr. Thrush, it was improper for her to do so. Rogers acknowledged Western's policy requiring students to direct disability accommodation requests to the AARC. There is no evidence that Rogers submitted a renewed request to the AARC for an academic schedule change in February 2015.
