In keeping with the current trend in constitutional challenges to the enforcement of immigration statutes, the district court issued a classwide, nationwide preliminary injunction against the operation of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii). But Congress plainly barred lower courts from issuing such injunctions except as to "an individual alien," 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1), and the Supreme Court has construed § 1252(f)(1) as a jurisdictional bar on a lower court's ability to issue classwide injunctive relief. Despite this authority (and the plain language of the statute, general statutory construction principles, and the holdings of two of our sister circuits), the majority opinion finds jurisdiction in this case.
I respectfully dissent.
I.
Section 1252(f)(1) is straightforward. It provides that:
Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter . . . other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.
8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). Recognizing the simplicity of this language, the Supreme Court  has repeatedly interpreted this statute as a bar on classwide injunctive relief against the operation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1232. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 851, 200 L. Ed. 2d 122 (2018) (confirming that § 1252(f)(1) bars federal courts from issuing classwide injunctive relief against the operation of §§ 1221-1232); Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 431, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 173 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2009) (describing § 1252(f)(1) as "a provision prohibiting class wide injunctions against the operation of removal provisions"); Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. ("AADC"), 525 U.S. 471, 481-82, 119 S. Ct. 936, 142 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1999) ("By its plain terms, and even by its title, that provision is nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief. It prohibits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief against the operation of §§ 1221-123[2], but specifies that this ban does not extend to individual cases.").
The majority opinion brushes these cases aside because the Supreme Court has yet to construe § 1252(f)(1) in a case brought by a class of aliens all of whom were in removal proceedings. Maj. Op. 30-31. Although the majority opinion is correct that AADC and Nken were not class actions brought by aliens in removal proceedings, Jennings was such a class proceeding. And in that case, the Court was dubious that a lower court would have jurisdiction to issue a classwide injunction in the context of a constitutional challenge to §§ 1221-1232. See Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 851 (explaining that the Ninth Circuit's reasoning for exercising jurisdiction over a class action statutory claim seeking injunctive relief against the operation of §§ 1225-1226 "does not seem to apply to an order granting relief on constitutional grounds").1 
Nothing in the Supreme Court's precedent suggests that the Court has changed its mind since deciding Jennings. And, even if we characterize the Court's repeated statements about § 1252(f)(1) as dicta, we are "advised to follow" them. Lemoge v. United States, 587 F.3d 1188, 1193 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d 1121, 1129 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc)); see, e.g., United States v. Montero-Camargo, 208 F.3d 1122, 1132 n.17 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (noting that "Supreme Court dicta have a weight that is greater than ordinary judicial dicta as prophecy of what that Court might hold" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The majority opinion does not follow the Court's interpretation of § 1252(f)(1), but then fails to persuasively explain why the Court would—despite its skepticism in Jennings—rule differently in the circumstances of this case.
Even if we could (or should) sidestep Jennings, Nken, and AADC, a proper statutory analysis leads to the same result. The majority opinion's conclusion that jurisdiction exists is based on a faulty reading of § 1252(f)(1)'s plain language and misapplication of statutory construction principles.
II.
When construing a statute, "no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant." TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S. Ct. 441, 151 L. Ed. 2d 339 (2001) (citation omitted). The majority opinion's reading of § 1252(f)(1)— specifically its interpretation of "an individual alien"—departs from this long-established rule. As the majority opinion construes the statute, the word "individual" stands as a mere superfluity. See Hamama v. Adducci ("Hamama I"), 912 F.3d 869, 877 (6th Cir. 2018) ("There is no way to square the concept of a class action lawsuit with the wording 'individual' in [§ 1252(f)(1)].").
The majority opinion defines "individual" as the opposite of "organization," apparently concluding that Congress added "individual" to § 1252(f)(1) to ensure that "alien" refers to a person, not an artificial entity. Maj. Op. 32. But this definition renders "individual" superfluous because an organizational or artificial entity "alien" does not exist for purposes of the immigration statutes. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3) (defining "alien" as "any person not a citizen or national of the United States"). To be given effect, "individual" can only be read as an adjective providing a separate, numerical limitation on the clause's noun, "alien." See Individual, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (defining "individual" when used as an adjective as "[e]xisting as an indivisible entity" or "[o]f, relating to, or involving a single person or thing, as opposed to a group" (emphasis added)).2 
The majority opinion's construction would be palatable only if Congress had replaced the phrase "an individual alien" with "any alien" or "an alien"—as it did in over a dozen other subsections of the statute. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(2)(C), 1252(b)(3)(B), 1252(b)(4)(C), 1252(b)(9), 1252(e)(1)(A), 1252(e)(4)(B), 1252(f)(2), 1252(g).3  Had Congress used either of these alternatives, there would be no separate numerical limitation on "alien," there would be no reason for us to define "individual," and the majority opinion's perceived legislative goal of preventing organization-led preemptive challenges to immigration statutes would be achieved. But we cannot rewrite the statute, see Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 359, 125 S. Ct. 2478, 162 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2005) ("[W]e are not free to rewrite the statute that Congress has enacted."), nor can we overlook Congress's use of different language in separate provisions of the same statute, see Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 711 n.9, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 159 L. Ed. 2d 718 (2004). Congress specifically precluded lower courts from issuing injunctive relief except as to "an individual alien," and that is the language we must enforce. See Dodd, 545 U.S. at 359. And because Congress "use[d] certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, [we] assume[] different meanings were intended." Sosa, 542 U.S. at 711 n.9 (citation omitted).
III.
The majority opinion also posits that if Congress intended to bar classwide injunctive relief, it would have explicitly barred class actions like it did in a neighboring statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1)(B). Maj. Op. 31-32. But barring class certification altogether (the function of § 1252(e)(1)(B))  fundamentally differs from barring a type of relief that a court can issue (the function of § 1252(f)(1)). The two statutes serve different purposes, and § 1252(f)(1) does not preclude class actions wholesale; it narrowly limits the available relief.
The majority opinion relies, in part, on Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1979), to argue that Congress did not intend to prohibit classwide injunctive relief in § 1252(f)(1). This reliance on Califano, a case analyzing a provision in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), is misplaced. In Califano, the Court found that a statute affirmatively authorizing a suit by "[a]ny individual" did not foreclose class actions because Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 "provides a procedure by which [a] court may exercise . . . jurisdiction over the various individual claims in a single proceeding." 442 U.S. at 701. But 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) and 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) differ materially in form and in substance. The former explicitly authorizes "[a]ny individual" to file a lawsuit and thus is a jurisdictional conferring statute. See 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). It does not prohibit a court from issuing a specific form of relief, nor does it carve out an exception to a general statutory bar. In contrast, the latter is a jurisdictional stripping statute that categorically bars a type of relief but carves out a narrow exception for "an individual alien." See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). It does not fully foreclose a class or multi-party lawsuit, see Rodriguez v. Marin, 909 F.3d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 2018), nor does it grant jurisdiction, see AADC, 525 U.S. at 481-82. And in contrast to § 405(g)'s use of "individual" as a standalone noun, § 1252(f)(1) uses "individual" as an adjective to numerically limit "alien." In short, Califano "does not stop the [c]ourt from looking at a particular statute that uses the word 'individual' and determining that, even if the use of 'individual' does not always bar class actions, it does bar them in the particular statute at issue." Hamama I, 912 F.3d at 878.
Section 1252(f)(1)'s title ("Limit on injunctive relief") and its first clause ("Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action") further demonstrate its functional difference from 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1)(B) and 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). As recognized by the Supreme Court, § 1252(f)(1)'s title portends what the language of the statute makes plain: the statute generally prohibits injunctive relief. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 481-82. And its opening clause recognizes that a lower court has jurisdiction over cases filed by multiple "parties," but states that "[r]egardless" of whether the action is brought by one "party" or multiple "parties," lower courts cannot issue injunctive relief except as to "an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated." 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). Thus, by its explicit terms, § 1252(f)(1) bars both classwide injunctions and injunctive relief for aliens who are not in removal proceedings.
IV.
Perhaps seeking a foothold for its shaky analysis, the majority opinion also resorts to the statute's legislative history. Maj. Op. 32-34. But "where, as here, the words of the statute are unambiguous, the judicial inquiry is complete." Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 98, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 156 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997) ("Our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The majority opinion fails to identify any  ambiguity in § 1252(f)(1), nor have I discovered any such language.
In any event, the scant discussion in the statute's legislative history specifically addressing § 1252(f)(1) does not salvage the majority opinion's interpretation. Without explaining the relevance, the majority opinion first notes that Congress enacted § 1252(f)(1) after a "period" when organizational plaintiffs filed "preemptive challenges" against "the enforcement of certain immigration statutes." Maj. Op. 32. This statement may be true as far as it goes, but we should not bootstrap our interpretation of a statute on a hypothesis that Congress silently intended the legislation to prevent organization-led preemptive lawsuits of which it may have been unaware.4 
The majority opinion also relies on a House Committee report to support its reading of § 1252(f)(1) as allowing classwide injunctive relief when each class member "is in removal proceedings and facing an immediate violation of rights." Maj. Op. 33-34. The relevant portion of this report provides, in full, as follows:
Section 306 also limits the authority of Federal courts other than the Supreme Court to enjoin the operation of the new removal procedures established in this legislation. These limitations do not preclude challenges to the new procedures, but the procedures will remain in force while such lawsuits are pending. In addition, courts may issue injunctive relief pertaining to the case of an individual alien, and thus protect against any immediate violation of rights. However, single district courts or courts of appeal do not have authority to enjoin procedures established by Congress to reform the process of removing illegal aliens from the U.S.
H.R. Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 161 (1996).
Although this report holds "no binding legal effect," Nw. Envtl. Def. Ctr. v. Bonneville Power Admin., 477 F.3d 668, 684 (9th Cir. 2007), the majority opinion emphasizes the phrase "immediate violation of rights." In so doing, it overlooks the preceding clause: "courts may issue injunctive relief pertaining to the case of an individual alien." H.R. Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 161 (emphasis added). Like the statute itself, this language specifically describes the scope of the carve out using singular phrasing. And the next sentence firmly states that lower courts cannot "enjoin procedures established by Congress to reform the process of removing illegal aliens from the U.S." Id. Contrary to the majority opinion's view, this report shows that Congress wanted to prevent lower courts from issuing sweeping injunctions—such as the classwide, nationwide injunction at issue here—against its enacted removal procedures.
In sum, the legislative history does not support the majority opinion's reading of § 1252(f)(1). It is ambiguous at best and cannot override the clear statutory language. See Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1814, 204 L. Ed. 2d 139 (2019) ("[E]ven those of us who believe that clear legislative history can illuminate ambiguous text won't allow ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
  V.
I am not the first to conclude that § 1252(f)(1) bars classwide injunctive relief under the circumstances of this case. In a constitutional challenge to continued detention under the immigration statutes brought by a class of aliens in removal proceedings, the Sixth Circuit applied the Supreme Court's reading of § 1252(f)(1) to hold that the statute bars classwide injunctive relief. See Hamama I, 912 F.3d at 877 ("In our view, [AADC] unambiguously strips federal courts of jurisdiction to enter class-wide injunctive relief[.]"); see also Hamama v. Adducci ("Hamama II"), 946 F.3d 875, 877 (6th Cir. 2020) ("Congress stripped all courts, save for the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the operation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1232 on a class-wide basis." (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1))). The Tenth Circuit reached the same result. See Van Dinh v. Reno, 197 F.3d 427, 433 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that "§ 1252(f) forecloses jurisdiction to grant class-wide injunctive relief to restrain operation of §§ 1221-[12]3[2] by any court other than the Supreme Court").
We should "decline to create a circuit split unless there is a compelling reason to do so." Kelton Arms Condo. Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. Homestead Ins. Co., 346 F.3d 1190, 1192 (9th Cir. 2003). The majority opinion fails to identify such a "compelling reason." As a result, even though we trail two other circuits in addressing this issue, the majority opinion makes us the first and only circuit to conclude that § 1252(f)(1) does not bar classwide injunctive relief.
VI.
Even if the district court had jurisdiction to issue classwide injunctive relief, the preliminary injunction is overbroad and extends far beyond the demands of due process.
The district court certified the Bond Hearing Class as:
All detained asylum seekers who entered the United States without inspection, were initially subject to expedited removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), were determined to have a credible fear of persecution, but are not provided a bond hearing with a verbatim transcript or recording of the hearing within seven days of requesting a bond hearing.
Padilla v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf't, No. C18-928 MJP, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36473, 2019 WL 1056466, at *1 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 6, 2019). The district court then issued the two-part preliminary injunction that is the subject of this appeal. In Part A of the injunction, the district court ordered the government to provide bond hearings with various procedures that supposedly are required by the Constitution, including that the hearings be conducted within seven days of a request. Padilla v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 387 F. Supp. 3d 1219, 1232 (W.D. Wash. 2019). In Part B, the district court "f[ound] that the statutory prohibition at [§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)] against releasing on bond persons found to have a credible fear and awaiting a determination of their asylum application violates the U.S. Constitution." Id. In Part B, the district court also found that "the Bond Hearing Class is constitutionally entitled to a bond hearing before a neutral decisionmaker (under the conditions enumerated [in Part A]) pending resolution of their asylum applications." Id.
The majority opinion concludes that "[t]he current record is . . . insufficient to support the district court's findings with respect to likelihood of success, the harms facing plaintiffs, and the balance of the equities implicated by Part A of the preliminary injunction—and particularly with  respect to the requirement that the class members receive a bond hearing within seven days of making such a request or be released." Maj. Op. 28. The majority opinion finds that the record "does not contain sufficient specific evidence justifying a seven-day timeline, as opposed to a 14-day, 21-day, or some other timeline." Maj. Op. 28. Ultimately, the majority opinion affirms Part B "except to the extent that it requires that bond hearings be administered under the conditions enumerated in Part A" and remands Part A for "further factual development and consideration" of the bond hearing procedures. Maj. Op. 36.
This holding raises multiple concerns, and Part B's breadth is the most troublesome. Plaintiffs concede that they do not assert a facial challenge to § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii). Nonetheless, in Part B the district court deems the statute unconstitutional in its entirety, rather than as applied to the Bond Hearing Class. See Padilla, 387 F. Supp. 3d at 1232 ("[F]ind[ing] that the statutory prohibition at [§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)] against releasing on bond persons found to have a credible fear and awaiting a determination of their asylum application violates the U.S. Constitution[.]"). Section 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) requires the government to detain multiple categories of aliens, not only those aliens who meet the definition of the Bond Hearing Class.5  But the district court did not exclude from its sweeping finding of unconstitutionality the application of the statute to detain other aliens who are not members of the Bond Hearing Class, such as "arriving" aliens under § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). By rendering § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) wholly unconstitutional, Part B is overbroad.6 
Furthermore, the majority opinion suggests that although the record does not support a seven-day deadline for bond hearings, it may support a 14-day, 21-day, or other unspecified but presumably similarly limited deadline. See Maj. Op. 28. But decisions made in similar contexts by the Supreme Court and this court establish that due process is not so demanding. Rather, these cases hold that, as a constitutional matter, the government need only provide bond hearings to detained aliens once the detention becomes "prolonged" or fails to serve its immigration purpose, a  period generally understood to be six months. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386, 125 S. Ct. 716, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005) (applying a "6-month presumptive detention period"); Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 527-31, 123 S. Ct. 1708, 155 L. Ed. 2d 724 (2003) (upholding as constitutional the detention of aliens for the entire duration of removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)); Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699, 701-02 (holding that six months is a "presumptively reasonable period of detention" under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6)); Marin, 909 F.3d at 256-57 (expressing doubt "that any statute that allows for arbitrary prolonged detention without any process is constitutional"); Diouf v. Napolitano, 634 F.3d 1081, 1092 n.13 (9th Cir. 2011) (defining detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) as "prolonged when it has lasted six months and is expected to continue more than minimally beyond six months").7 
Although "detention during deportation proceedings [i]s a constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process," Demore, 538 U.S. at 523, the majority opinion cites no decision from the Supreme Court or this court suggesting that two or three weeks constitutes "prolonged" detention.8 
VII.
The majority opinion does not square with the plain text of § 1252(f)(1), is inconsistent with multiple Supreme Court cases, and needlessly creates a circuit split. Despite Congress unequivocally barring lower courts from issuing classwide injunctions against the operation of certain immigration statutes, the majority opinion gives a green light for the district courts in this circuit (as well as this court) to issue (and uphold) such relief. And, even if the district court had jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief, the preliminary injunction is overbroad and exceeds what the Constitution demands.
I would vacate the preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings with instructions to dismiss the claims for classwide injunctive relief. I respectfully dissent.
