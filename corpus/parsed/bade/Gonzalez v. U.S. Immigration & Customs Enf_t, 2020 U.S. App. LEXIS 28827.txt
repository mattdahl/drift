The plaintiffs in this case seek classwide orders enjoining Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from using certain databases when deciding whether to issue immigration detainers and from collaborating with law enforcement in certain states to detain suspected removable aliens. It is difficult to see how such orders would not work to "enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part IV" of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 1  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). Because Congress has enacted a clear jurisdictional bar to such relief in § 1252(f)(1), I respectfully dissent.
I
The majority reasons that because 8 U.S.C. § 1357(d) is the only provision in the INA that explicitly mentions immigration detainers, and it "is not located in 'Part IV,'" § 1252(f)(1) does not bar injunctive relief in this case. Maj. Op. 42 n.16. I find this approach flawed for two reasons.
First, the majority purportedly relies on the plain language of the statute to conclude that § 1252(f)(1) does not bar injunctive relief in this case. Maj. Op. 40. But its interpretation ignores the plain language of the statute, which prohibits classwide injunctive relief that would "enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part IV." § 1252(f)(1) (emphasis added). Under the majority's interpretation, § 1252(f)(1) would not bar an order that enjoins or restrains any important law enforcement tool that ICE employs to enforce the provisions of part IV (such as the tools identified in § 1357, "Powers of immigration officers and employees"), 2  unless that tool is specifically identified in part IV. Thus, the majority reads the words "the operation of" out of the statute.
Second, the majority's analysis of § 1252(f)(1) relies on the apparent conclusion that § 1357(d) is the entire source of ICE's detainer authority. Maj. Op. 42-43. But the statute's plain language renders that conclusion implausible. Section 1357(d) does not authorize or define detainers. Instead, it provides that, under certain circumstances, an immigration officer must promptly determine "whether or not to issue a detainer" for an alien arrested for a controlled substances offense. § 1357(d)(3). In fact, nothing about the structure or text of the INA suggests that § 1357(d) is the sole source of ICE's authority to issue detainers to facilitate the arrest and detention of suspected removable aliens.
A
The majority concludes that § 1252(f)(1) does not apply to provisions that fall outside of part IV of the INA. Maj. Op. 40-41. But § 1252(f)(1) does not insulate provisions from injunctive relief; it insulates the operation of those provisions. Thus, § 1252(f)(1) bars classwide injunctive relief that restrains "the operation of" provisions within part IV of the INA, even if ICE's authority to enforce the provisions of part IV comes, in part, from provisions that are not within part IV. See § 1252(f)(1) (emphasis added). The statute reads:
(f) Limit on injunctive relief
(1) In general
Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter . . . other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.
§ 1252(f)(1). By barring the lower courts from issuing classwide relief that "enjoin[s] or restrain[s] the operation of the provisions of part IV," id., Congress requires the lower courts to determine whether the requested relief has the effect of enjoining or restraining the operation of the provisions at issue; if so, then the lower courts lack jurisdiction to grant that relief. 3  See Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 481-82, 119 S. Ct. 936, 142 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1999) ("By its plain terms, and even by its title, [§ 1252(f)(1)] is nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief. It prohibits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief against the operation of §§ 1221-1231, but specifies that this ban does not extend to individual cases.").
The majority, however, does not undertake this analysis. Instead, in its view, § 1252(f)(1) is inapplicable unless the object of the requested relief—in this case a detainer—is mentioned in a provision that appears in part IV. Thus, the majority erroneously focuses exclusively on what it considers the source of the detainer power without regard for the effects of restricting that power. See, e.g., Vazquez Perez v. Decker, 18-cv-10683, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170185, 2019 WL 4784950, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019) ("The relevant inquiry, then, is whether the . . . injunctive relief [the plaintiff] seeks on a classwide basis would enjoin or restrain the method or manner of functioning of Sections 1221-1232."). Even if some provision outside part IV authorizes immigration detainers, we must go further and ask whether the classwide injunctions sought here, by restricting ICE's ability to apprehend and detain suspected removable aliens, impose "limitations on what the government can . . . do under the removal and detention provisions." Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 880 (6th Cir. 2018).
Although the § 1252(f)(1) inquiry may involve locating the statute authorizing the conduct at issue, that is not the whole inquiry. The ultimate question is not simply whether the authority for that conduct comes from part IV, but whether a court order restricting that conduct "enjoin[s] or restrain[s] the operation of" part IV. § 1252(f)(1) (emphasis added). If the majority reached this question, it could not avoid concluding that the classwide relief Plaintiffs request directly implicates ICE's statutory charge under part IV to apprehend and detain suspected removable aliens because it restricts ICE's power to issue detainers, which serve "the purpose of arresting and removingalien[s]." Mendia v. Garcia, 768 F.3d 1009, 1011 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 287.7(a)).
B
Moreover, the majority ties its analysis of § 1252(f)(1) to what it apparently considers the source of ICE's authority to issue detainers, § 1357(d). Because this is the only INA provision that explicitly mentions detainers, and because § 1357(d) falls outside part IV, the majority concludes that the analysis is complete and § 1252(f)(1) does not apply. Maj. Op. 44. I disagree. Even if we assume that the § 1252(f)(1) inquiry turns on the source of the detainer power, it is implausible that ICE's power to issue immigration detainers stems entirely from § 1357(d).
That provision, entitled "Detainer of aliens for violation of controlled substances laws," reads:
In the case of an alien who is arrested by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official for a violation of any law relating to controlled substances, if the official (or another official)—
(1) has reason to believe that the alien may not have been lawfully admitted to the United States or otherwise is not lawfully present in the United States,
(2) expeditiously informs an appropriate officer or employee of the Service authorized and designated by the Attorney General of the arrest and of facts concerning the status of the alien, and
(3) requests the Service to determine promptly whether or not to issue a detainer to detain the alien,
the officer or employee of the Service shall promptly determine whether or not to issue such a detainer. If such a detainer is issued and the alien is not otherwise detained by Federal, State, or local officials, the Attorney General shall effectively and expeditiously take custody of the alien.
§ 1357(d).
Although it uses the term "detainer" in its title and three more times in its text, § 1357(d) never defines the term. The statute seems to assume that there are standards to guide an officer in "determin[ing] whether or not to issue such a detainer," but it does not provide or point to any standards itself. Id. In fact, § 1357(d) never explicitly authorizes the issuance of detainers at all—even though the same statute enumerates, in three other places, actions that "[a]ny officer of employee of the Service . . . shall have the power" to take. § 1357(a)-(c) (emphasis added); see Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) ("[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion." (alteration in original) (citation omitted)). Nothing in the text of § 1357(d) suggests that it is the source of congressional authorization for ICE to issue detainers; rather, it simply mandates ICE's prompt response to detainer requests under certain, very specific circumstances involving controlled substances offenses.
To conclude otherwise by disregarding the plain language of § 1357(d) and interpreting it as the sole source of ICE's detainer authority—rather than as a requirement for ICE to respond promptly to detainer requests in cases involving controlled substances offenses—carries troubling implications. If § 1357(d) is the sole source of authorization for immigration detainers, future plaintiffs could argue that ICE acts ultra vires whenever it issues a detainer for a suspect who was not arrested for a controlled substance offense. See, e.g., Comm. for Immigrant Rts. of Sonoma Cnty. v. County of Sonoma, 644 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1198 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (rejecting plaintiffs' argument "that [8 C.F.R.] § 287.7 is facially invalid because its authorizing statute, § 1357, limits ICE's authority to issue detainers for aliens in custody for violating laws relating to controlled substances"). 4  Such an argument would have far-reaching consequences, and although unsupported by the plain language of INA provisions at issue, it would seem to garner support from the majority's conclusion that § 1357(d) is the sole source of ICE's detainer authority.
In contrast to what the text of § 1357(d) actually provides, the majority's citation to McLean v. Crabtree, 173 F.3d 1176, 1185 n.12 (9th Cir. 1999), bears little weight. There, the court noted in dicta that "[t]he INS has authority to lodge a detainer against a prisoner under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(d)." Id. Thus, the court in McLean suggested that § 1357(d) is a source of detainer authority, but it certainly did not hold that it is the only source.
The majority also notes that 8 U.S.C. § 1103 authorizes DHS "to promulgat[e] regulations to carry out the provisions of the INA," but asserts that "[w]hat matters here is that that general grant of authority is not located in 'Part IV.'" Maj. Op. 42 n.16. Thus, the majority seems to suggest that, even if we consider § 1103 an additional or alternative source of ICE's detainer power, § 1252(f)(1) does not bar the classwide relief Plaintiffs request because § 1103 is not in part IV of the INA. 5  But grounding ICE's detainer power in § 1103—a "general grant of power to administer and enforce all immigration laws," Castaneda-Gonzalez v. INS, 564 F.2d 417, 423, 183 U.S. App. D.C. 396 (D.C. Cir. 1977)—does not answer whether § 1252(f)(1) bars the relief Plaintiffs request. Section 1103 is ultimately the statutory source of all of ICE's authority, including ICE's detainer authority, but that does not mean that ICE does not also derive its detainer authority from other provisions of the INA, including part IV, which authorizes the "Inspection, Apprehension, Examination, Exclusion, and Removal" of aliens.
Although we need not determine the sources of ICE's detainer authority to determine whether enjoining that authority "enjoin[s] or restrain[s] the operation of the provisions of part IV," § 1252(f)(1), we can nonetheless avoid all these problems of the majority's approach by acknowledging that the power to issue detainers—that is, to request that another law enforcement officer detain a suspect—arises impliedly from the INA statutes authorizing officers to arrest and detain suspects themselves. See, e.g., Santoyo v. United States, No. 5:16-CV-855-OLG, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 205795, 2017 WL 6033861, at *3 & n.3 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 18, 2017) (collecting cases and concluding that "[a]lthough no other provision of the INA specifically authorizes the issuance of detainer requests, that authority predates the INA and has long been viewed as implied by federal immigration enforcers' authority to arrest those suspected of being removable."). Indeed, this is the Department of Homeland Security's interpretation of the statutes it administers. 6  The Department has stated that it issues detainers "pursuant to sections 236 [8 U.S.C. § 1226] and 287 [8 U.S.C. § 1357] of the Act." 8 C.F.R. § 287.7(a).
Section 1357 is not in part IV, but § 1226 is, and its broad authorization to arrest and detain aliens accords with the conclusion that the detainer power stems from ICE's arrest and detention powers under part IV. Compare 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) ("On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States."), with 8 C.F.R. § 287.7(a) (stating that detainers serve "the purpose of arresting and removing the alien"). 7  Thus, even under the majority's flawed approach
of applying § 1252(f)(1)'s bar only to law enforcement tools that part IV itself authorizes, it should have concluded that classwide relief was barred here because part IV does authorize detainers, albeit impliedly, when it authorizes ICE to arrest and detain suspected removable aliens.
II
The majority's approach overlooks § 1252(f)(1)'s insulation of "the operation of" the immigration enforcement provisions in part IV of the INA from judicial classwide injunctions. §1252(f)(1). And because the majority misapplies its own purportedly textualist approach, it erroneously concludes that the sole source of ICE's entire detainer power is a statute that merely requires officers to promptly decide whether to issue detainers for aliens arrested for controlled substances offenses. Because the majority's approach misreads § 1252(f)(1) and opens the door to sweeping challenges to basic tools of immigration enforcement, I respectfully dissent.
